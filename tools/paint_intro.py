"""Repaint the main-menu backgrounds (INTRFACE/INTRG.GIF, INTRO.GIF) at any framebuffer size.

The first menu after the intro movie (NEW CAMPAIGN, TRAINING, LOAD GAME, ...) is the script
`bintroe` (main.c `bintro` 0x00404DC8): background INTRG.GIF, the `DCUK` logo animation, the `DCUT`
title, and the scrolling credits.txt box that the *code* positions. `introe` is the same menu on
INTRO.GIF with the `DCSS` logo (not reached by the retail exe, which only names intrface/bintro),
and `BUTTONSE` / `DINTROE` are demo leftovers on INTRO.GIF. Council Wars shares the GIFs and
sprites and adds `exp/intrface/BINTROE` / `INTROE` overrides with one column of buttons. Both
stock GIFs are the same 640x480 picture - a starfield and the rim-lit limb of Mars - and differ
only in the bottom band (Take 2 logo and copyright in INTRG, SSI logo, red rule and copyright in
INTRO). At 1024x768 `pad_background.py` letterboxes them, which leaves black borders around a
640x480 picture. This tool paints genuine full-frame versions instead.

Design rules (docs/DC16_DISPLAY_AND_RESOLUTION.md section 10.11):

* Nothing is resampled. The starfield and the planet are *procedural*: the master is the code and
  its parameters below, measured from the stock art (planet circle centre (320, 351) radius 291
  in the 640x480 frame, 10 px atmospheric glow outside the limb, a lit crescent 45 px deep at the
  top that fades out by +-75 degrees, 4.95e-3 stars per pixel with 2/3 of them faint). Any later
  resolution is a re-render. The SSI logo, rule and copyright line are pixel art at UI scale like
  the buttons and the DC logo; they are copied 1:1 from the stock file (the rule is extended to
  the full width), never scaled.
* The 256-entry colour table is the game's master palette (identical to PALETTE.GIF) and is kept
  byte for byte: gifload.c feeds indices straight into the shade LUT and INTRO.RGB / INTRO.RMP
  are derived from this palette. The render is quantised to the nearest existing colour (index 0
  excluded: it is the sprite-transparent black; black is index 254 as in the stock file).
* The output keeps the byte layout the game's GIF parser expects (GIF87a, global colour table,
  image descriptor next, no extension blocks) - verified with pad_background.check_gif_layout.
* The logo sprites drawn `unmask` over the picture carry the stock backdrop baked into their
  cells (see SCREENS below); `apply` re-bakes them. The gadget names an *animation*
  (`ANIMATE/DCUK.FIN`, listed in `INTRG.DAT`), whose frames name the sprite bank `dcuk`, and
  animate.c opens banks through "sprites/%s" (0x00425356) - so the frames the game draws come
  from SPRITES/DCUK.SPR, while INTRFACE/DCUK.SPR is a byte-identical copy. `apply` re-bakes
  every copy it finds (learned from the third game test, which still showed the stock stars).

The scripts then go back to `size W H` with their widgets laid out for the new canvas: title,
credits and buttons form one cluster that keeps its stock vertical centre as a fraction of the
height and is centred horizontally (the button grid as a unit, the title on its own); the DC logo
moves with the cluster so that it stays right above the title as in the original, centred. The
credits box is positioned by two immediates in the exe; `plan`/`apply` print where it has to go
and `patch_resolution.py` stage 2 puts it there (fixups 0x42A0 / 0x4299).

CLI
    python paint_intro.py render OUT.GIF --stock INTRG.GIF.bak [--width 1024 --height 768] [--seed 7]
    python paint_intro.py plan   GAME_DIR [--width 1024 --height 768]
    python paint_intro.py apply  GAME_DIR [--width 1024 --height 768] [--seed 7]
    python paint_intro.py preview GAME_DIR OUT.png [--script bintroe]   # logo, title, buttons

`apply` renders INTRFACE/INTRG.GIF and INTRO.GIF (keeping a .bak of each stock 640x480 file if
none exists yet), re-bakes DCUK.SPR, DCUT.SPR and DCSS.SPR, and rewrites `bintroe`, `introe`,
`BUTTONSE`, `DINTROE` and the `exp/intrface` overrides from their pristine copies.
`pad_background.py` recognises the result (a script already at `size W H` for the target size)
and leaves it alone; its `revert` restores the stock files.

# Script -> background GIF and the `unmask` logo sprites drawn over it (the sprite names as
# they appear in the gadget lines). Matched case-insensitively; the Council Wars overrides in
# `exp/intrface` use the same entries. Rebake modes:
#   'full'  - the cell carries sky, stars and the limb (DCSS: 15 frames, DCUK: 14 frames,
#             frame 0 of DCUK a solid flash). Black is index 0, never 254. That backdrop is
#             *another quantisation* of the stock scene (only ~20 % of the limb pixels equal
#             the GIF byte for byte) and the letters shimmer from frame to frame, so a pixel is
#             taken as backdrop if it agrees with the per-pixel mode across the frames where
#             that mode has >= PLATE_MIN_AGREE supporters, or has a limb colour (orange / red /
#             brown ramp), or is a non-limb speck of <= STAR_MAX_PX connected pixels (a star),
#             or is black sky more than 1 px from the letters (their black shadows stay 0).
#   'black' - the backdrop becomes plain black (index 0): the maintainer wants the DC logo on
#             black, and at its new place over the dark disc the background is black anyway.
#             Because nothing has to be preserved but the logo, the rule is stricter than
#             'full': after the plate / limb-colour pass, a pixel also counts as backdrop if it
#             equals the *reference frame* (the frame with the least logo in it, i.e. the static
#             baked backdrop), and then everything that is not a piece of >= PIECE_MIN_PX
#             connected pixels is dropped too - stars glued to a piece's edge, halos of bright
#             stars (up to ~100 px), the glow streak of the limb. Small fragments survive only
#             when they are logo-coloured (colours found in the big pieces but not in the
#             reference backdrop). The fourth game test showed the light leftovers this fixes.
#   'stars' - the sprite sits over the black disc (DCUT title, 5 frames incl. a solid flash and
#             a red glow that the limb-colour rule must not touch): only pixels equal to a
#             non-black stock-backdrop pixel underneath (a baked star) are replaced.
#   'art'   - not re-baked here at all: the bank is re-set by tools/logo_art.py (the title of
#             the live menu, 10 Sep 2026). The DC mark stays the original pixel art on black:
#             two re-renders of it were rejected by the maintainer the same day.
