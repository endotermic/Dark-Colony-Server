# Dark Colony `dc16.exe` — Display Pipeline and the 1024×768 Upgrade

Reverse-engineering notes on how Classic `dc16.exe` (`DC - Classic/dc16.exe`, MD5
`aa0a646b1234d1d9815a2b7480fd080b`) puts pixels on the screen — DirectDraw setup, the internal
"screen" and graphics-context objects, the sprite blitters, the in-game HUD geometry, the mouse and
the movie player (§1–§7) — followed by the complete inventory of resolution-dependent code sites
(§8) and a staged plan to raise the game from 640×480 to 1024×768 (§9–§12).

All addresses are virtual addresses in Classic `dc16.exe` (`VA = file_offset + 0x400C00` for the
`AUTO` code section, `VA = file_offset + 0x402800` for `DGROUP`). Council Wars `ENGEXP16.EXE`
(MD5 `50419d438427d31341057e9723724f66`) is the same code base; §8 lists its file offsets too, all
byte-verified, and §10.10 has the three places where it is not a plain shift of Classic and how
the patch was carried over. Council Wars `dc16.exe` (MD5 `4180f6e9d01925b23eac0eb335e0b95e`) is a
different build and is *not* covered except for the two globals in §3.

**Names, 10 Sep 2026:** the expansion executable was renamed `ENGEXP16.EXE` → **`DCEXP16.EXE`**
(same bytes; the tools identify builds by MD5, not by name), the unrelated Council Wars `dc16.exe`
was removed from the repository, and so was the Ghidra project (`DecompiledWithGhidra/`, whose
databases were never tracked). The text below keeps the old names; both files are in the git
history before that commit.

Calling convention is Watcom register-based: the first four arguments in `eax, edx, ebx, ecx`.
Facts marked **(verified)** were read directly from the disassembly; facts marked *(inferred)* are
consistent with the code but were not traced to the end.

```

* The game is **16 bits per pixel**, RGB565 or RGB555 (whichever the card reports), *not* 8-bit
  paletted. All art on disk is 8-bit; it is expanded to 16-bit through a shading lookup table at
  draw time.
* All drawing is done by **CPU software blitters writing into one linear 16-bit buffer**. That
  buffer is a DirectDraw `DDSCAPS_OFFSCREENPLAIN | DDSCAPS_SYSTEMMEMORY` surface, locked once per
  frame; the code uses `lpSurface` only and **ignores `lPitch`**, assuming `pitch == width * 2`.
* DirectDraw is used only to get the buffer, to blit/flip it, to hold the mouse cursors, and to
  set the display mode. There is no hardware 2-D acceleration path and no scaling anywhere.
* **Every screen, the in-game HUD included, is a plain-text script** in `INTRFACE/` (§6). Only two
  things about the in-game screen are compiled in: where the map view is rendered and where the
  minimap is plotted (§5). Everything else — the panel frame art, all 163 HUD widgets and their
  coordinates — is data.

Modules involved (link order, boundaries from assert strings): `main.c`, `avi.c`, `proto.c`,
`widget.c`, `gadget.c`, `animate.c`, `button.c`, `driver.c`, `ddex4.c`, `interface.c`, `marker.c`,
`engmain.c`, `sprites.c`, `text.c`, `gifload.c`, `juicel.c`, `image.c`, `mouse.c`, `tile.c`,
`mapit.c`, `lighting.c`, `sprite.c`.

## 2. DirectDraw layer (`ddex4.c`) **(verified)**

Imports used: `DDRAW.dll!DirectDrawCreate` only (thunk `0x0047F11C`); everything else goes through
the COM vtables. `GDI32` `BitBlt`/`CreateCompatibleDC` and `USER32` `LoadImageA` are used for the
two loading-screen bitmaps and nothing else.

| Function | Address | What it does |
|---|---|---|
| `win_init` | `0x0042E7B4` | `GetVersionExA`; sets mouse to screen centre (320,240); `DirectDrawCreate`; `SetCooperativeLevel(hwnd, DDSCL_ALLOWMODEX \| DDSCL_EXCLUSIVE \| DDSCL_FULLSCREEN)`; `set_mode_16`; `create_surfaces`; sound init |
| `create_window` | `0x0042E688` | `LoadIconA`, `RegisterClassA`, `CreateWindowExA(0, cls, title, WS_POPUP, 0, 0, W, H, …)` — **reads the globals of §3**, so no patch needed |
| `set_mode_8` | `0x0042E890` | `IDirectDraw::SetDisplayMode(640, 480, 8)` — live: called by `avi_end` |
| `set_mode_16` | `0x0042E914` | `IDirectDraw::SetDisplayMode(640, 480, 16)`; on failure prints "Setting to 16 bit mode Failure" and aborts |
| `create_surfaces` | `0x0042E998` | primary + 1 back buffer (`COMPLEX\|FLIP\|PRIMARYSURFACE`, video memory, falling back to any memory, 10 retries 500 ms apart, then error exit); `GetAttachedSurface(BACKBUFFER)`; a **640×480 `OFFSCREENPLAIN\|SYSTEMMEMORY`** surface; `GetSurfaceDesc` to detect RGB565 / RGB555; `CreatePalette`; 32 mouse cursors from `cursor/cursor%d.bmp` |
| `lock_screen` | `0x0042F828` | `Lock(offscreen)` → `screen->pixels = desc.lpSurface`. `lPitch` is discarded |
| `unlock_screen` | `0x0042F8D8` | `Unlock`; `screen->pixels = NULL` |
| `clear_screen` | `0x0042F774` | zeroes `0x4B000` (= 640·480) 16-bit words linearly, then `Flip` |
| `make_colour` | `0x0042F2D0` | `(r,g,b) → 16-bit` via three interleaved LUTs at `0x004DEC90/92/94` |
| `set_palette` | `0x0042F320` | rebuilds those LUTs and the shade table from a 768-byte palette |
| loading screen | `0x0042EEF6`…`0x0042F031` | `LoadImageA(0, "intrface/load.bmp"/"load2.bmp", IMAGE_BITMAP, 640, 480, LR_LOADFROMFILE\|LR_CREATEDIBSECTION)` → `GetDC(backbuffer)`, `BitBlt(0,0,640,480,SRCCOPY)`, `Flip` (function start not determined) |

Surface handles: `0x00489714` `IDirectDraw`, `0x00489718` primary, `0x0048971C` back buffer,
`0x00489720` the 640×480×16 offscreen work surface, `0x00489724` palette, `0x00489730` `HWND`,
`0x004DFE90[32]` cursor surfaces, `0x00489734` "screen is locked" flag.

Pixel-format detection stores the masks at `0x004DFF18` (R), `0x004DFF28` (G), `0x004DFF24` (B),
the format id at `screen+0x14` (`0x235` = RGB565, `0x22B` = RGB555) and a 50 %-brightness mask at
`screen+0x10` (`0x7BEF` / `0x3DEF`).

---

## 3. The two master dimension globals **(verified)**

```
DGROUP  0x00488DB4  dword = 640     screen width
DGROUP  0x00488DB8  dword = 480     screen height
```

These are **initialised data, never written at runtime**, and each is read at exactly four places:

| Reader | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `0x0042E6F4` / `0x0042E6ED` | `CreateWindowExA` width / height |
| `0x0042E82E` / `0x0042E83A` | `screen->width = W; screen->height = H` in `win_init` |
| `0x0044FFC7` / `0x0044FFCC` | `image.c` full-screen page: `malloc(W * H)` (8-bit) |
| `0x0044FFE0` / `0x0044FFE7` | same function: `image->width = W; image->height = H` |

They are preceded in `DGROUP` by the dword pair `0x14F, 0x16E` (335, 366 — purpose not
identified), which makes the 12-byte sequence

```
4F 01 6E 01 80 02 00 00 E0 01 00 00
```

a **unique anchor in all three binaries** — the reliable way to find these globals in any build:

| Binary | W offset | H offset |
|---|---|---|
| Classic `dc16.exe` | `0x865B4` | `0x865B8` |
| `ENGEXP16.EXE` | `0x867DC` | `0x867E0` |
| Council Wars `dc16.exe` | `0x868E0` | `0x868E4` |

Because `screen->width` doubles as the framebuffer **stride** for the main sprite blitter (§4),
changing these two dwords alone already moves a large part of the renderer to a new resolution.
It is *not* sufficient — §8 lists the ~60 places that hardcode the numbers independently.

---

## 4. The `screen` and graphics-context objects **(verified)**

`driver.c` `0x0042C29C` builds both:

```c
ctx    = malloc(0xEC);              /* "Screen" */
screen = new_screen();              /* 0x1A4 bytes, driver.c 0x0042BD78 */
ctx[0x20] = screen;
ctx[0x24] = gfx_descriptor;
screen[0xFC] = 0; install_ddraw_driver(screen);   /* ddex4.c 0x0042FBF0 */
assert(screen[0xFC] != 0);
ctx->clip   = make_rect(0, 0, 640, 480);    /* 0x0042C347 / 0x0042C363 */
ctx->bounds = make_rect(0, 0, 640, 480);
```

**`screen`** (0x1A4 bytes) is an *image* with the graphics driver's method table appended:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| `+0x00` | width **= stride in pixels** |
| `+0x04` | height |
| `+0x08` | pixel pointer (16-bit for the screen, 8-bit for `image.c` pages) |
| `+0x10` | u16 50 %-brightness mask |
| `+0x14` | pixel format id |
| `+0x18` | → shade / palette LUT block (`0x1802` bytes) |
| `+0xFC` | `win_init` |
| `+0x100`…`+0x1A0` | driver methods (graphics **and** sound — `driver.c` is the whole platform layer) |

**`ctx`** (0xEC bytes) is the drawing context every blitter receives in `eax`:

| Offset | Field |
|---|---|
| `+0x00`…`+0x0C` | clip rect `x0, y0, x1, y1` |
| `+0x10`…`+0x1C` | screen bounds rect |
| `+0x20` | → `screen` |
| `+0x24` | → gfx descriptor |
| `+0x29` | u8 "use shadow table" flag |
| `+0x30`…`+0x98` | method slots copied from `screen+0x100`… by `0x0042C405`ff; notably `+0x8C` `lock_screen`, `+0x90` `unlock_screen`, `+0x94` `set_origin` |

`make_rect(x, y, w, h)` is `0x004365BC` (`engmain.c`); it returns `{x, y, x+w, y+h}` by value
through `esi`. It is the single place rectangles are built, which makes it a useful breakpoint.

### The sprite-cell blitter `0x0044FAC0` (`juicel.c`) **(verified)**

The hot path, and the reason a resolution change is tractable at all:

```
screen = ctx[0x20]
stride = screen[0]                  <-- NOT a constant
base   = screen[8]
clip against ctx[0x00..0x0C]
dst    = base + (y*stride + x) * 2
src    = 8-bit cell data; each byte -> u16 through  [0x48C188] + level*512 + idx*2
```

It is fully resolution-independent. The same is true of the text (`text.c`), gadget and widget
drawing paths, which all go through it. There are exactly eleven `ctx+0x8C`/`ctx+0x90`
(`lock_screen`/`unlock_screen`) call sites, i.e. eleven **entry points** into framebuffer access —
everything else draws inside one of these brackets: `0x0042BCCE`, `0x0042BEFE`, `0x0042BFC1`,
`0x0042C146`, `0x0042C203` (`driver.c` generic rect/pixel ops), `0x00436399` (main map render, which
calls `draw_terrain` and `draw_objects` while holding the lock), `0x0043A095` and `0x0043A44F`
(minimap), `0x0044EA8C` (`gifload.c`), `0x0044FAED` and `0x0044FCCB` (`juicel.c`). That list is the
audit surface: any function that touches the framebuffer is reachable from one of them.

---

## 5. In-game screen layout **(verified)**

The whole HUD geometry is four numbers plus one byte offset:

```
screen                    640 x 480          (§3)
map viewport              512 x 448  at (4, 6)
   size   engmain.c  0x00435F46 (512) / 0x00435F61 (448)
   rect   proto.c    0x0041ED63 (x=4) / 0x0041ED6E (y=6) / 0x0041ED23 (512) / 0x0041ED1E (448)
   tiles  engmain.c  0x00435E4F (16 across) / 0x00435E47 (14 down)      <- 512/32, 448/32
minimap                    96 x  84  at (519, 6)
   size   engmain.c  0x0043A083 (96 cols) / 0x0043A07E (84 rows)
   steps  engmain.c  0x0043A463 (96<<8) / 0x0043A478 (84<<8)
   origin engmain.c  0x0043A0AF / 0x0043A484:  +0x220E bytes = (6*640 + 519) * 2
```

So the panel chrome is the right-hand strip `x = 516…639` (124 px) plus the bottom strip
`y = 454…479` (26 px). Tiles are **32×32 pixels**; world coordinates are `tile << 8` (8 fractional
bits), and the terrain renderer converts with `>> 5` (`0x004539B3`ff), i.e. the view origin
`0x005044AC`/`0x005044B0` is in **pixels**.

Every one of these numbers is independently confirmed by the HUD artwork and its layout script:
`INTRFACE.GIF` is opaque exactly on columns 0–3, rows 0–5 and columns 515–517, and all 75 panel
widgets in `MAINE` start at x ≥ 516 — see §6.1.

### The render view struct at `0x005044AC` **(verified)**

Set up by `engmain.c` `0x00435E7C`:

| Offset | Address | Value |
|---|---|---|
| `+0x00` | `0x005044AC` | i32 view x (pixels) |
| `+0x04` | `0x005044B0` | i32 view y (pixels) |
| `+0x08` | `0x005044B4` | destination pixel pointer |
| `+0x0C` | `0x005044B8` | u16 viewport width  = 512 |
| `+0x0E` | `0x005044BA` | u16 viewport height = 448 |
| `+0x10` | `0x005044BC` | u16 **destination stride in pixels = 640** (`0x00435F9F`) |
| `+0x14` | `0x005044C0` | → map (`0x9AA38` bytes, "kev: mapinfo") |
| `+0x18` | `0x005044C4` | → occlusion mask, `0x7000` bytes = 512·448/8 ("kev: maskbuffer", `0x00435F88`) |
| `+0x34` | `0x005044E0` | → tile-type table, `0x4260` bytes = 1416 × 12 ("kev: tilememory") — indexed by **tile type** (`0x00435FEF`), so resolution-independent |

Per-frame path (`engmain.c` `0x00436080` → `0x00435E7C`, and `0x00436380`ff):

```
lock_screen(ctx)
draw_ptr = screen[8] + (clip.y0 * 640 + clip.x0) * 2   <- 0x004363B6 (*5<<7), 0x004360B6 (*5<<8)
draw_terrain(view)          lighting.c 0x00453910
draw_objects(view)          sprite.c   0x004543FC
unlock_screen(ctx)
draw_minimap(ctx, ...)      engmain.c  0x0043A064 / 0x0043A43C
```

### Buffers that size themselves from the view struct **(verified)**

`lighting.c` `lighting_init` `0x00453770` is the model to imitate: it takes the view struct, reads
the viewport width and height back out of it (`[view+0x0A]>>16`, `[view+0x0C]>>16`), stores the
width in `0x0049931C` and the pixel count in `0x005360B0`, and allocates a 1-byte-per-pixel
"lightplane" of exactly that size into `view+0x1C`. `0x0049931C` is then used as the light-plane
row stride by the object renderer (`0x004542E8`, `0x00465051`, `0x00465401`, `0x004657B1`,
`0x00465B61`, `0x00465E6A`). **The allocation and the tile-to-tile addressing follow the viewport
size automatically** — changing the two immediates at `0x00435F46`/`0x00435F61` is enough for
them. Two things do not follow: the occlusion mask (`0x00435F88`) was written as a literal
`0x7000` and has to be patched by hand, and **`draw_terrain`'s fill of the lightplane advances
from one pixel row of a tile to the next by a literal `0x200` = 512 bytes**, 31 times
(`0x00453CCB…0x004542BC`), which is the stock viewport width in disguise — see §10.6.

### Buffers that are **not** resolution-dependent **(verified)**

Worth stating because it removes the hardest class of problem: **no static `.bss` buffer scales
with the screen size.** `0x00533C90` (`0x2420` bytes) is the fade/shading table read verbatim from
`FADE.DAT` (9248 bytes, `lighting.c` `0x004537AD`); the 289×32-byte loop at `0x00453970` only
rewrites its low 3 bits with the current light level. Everything that does scale — the map, the
flat maps, the occlusion mask, the `image.c` full-screen pages, the DirectDraw surfaces — is heap
or DirectDraw allocated. `.bss` runs `0x0049A000…0x00536E00` with `.reloc` immediately after at
`0x00537000`, so growing it in place would mean moving `.reloc` and `.rsrc`; that is not needed.

---

## 6. What is data, not code **(verified)**

**Every screen in the game — including the in-game HUD — is a plain-text script in `INTRFACE/`.**
There are **30** of them in Classic, parsed by `widget.c` `0x004232E2`ff and loaded by
`load_interface(app, name, flags)` `0x004231E8` (freed by `0x004231B0`):

| Script | `size` line | Script | `size` line |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MAINE` — **in-game HUD** | `size 640 480` | `LOGOE` | `size 640 480` |
| `NEWGAMEE` — main menu | `size 640 480` | `LOSTE` | `size 640 480` |
| `MULTIE` — lobby | `size 640 480` | `METAE` | `size 640 480` |
| `MULTIWNE` | `size 640 480` | `NETOPTE` | `size 640 480` |
| `GENERALE` | `size 640 480` | `STORYE` | `size 640 480` |
| `BUTTONSE` | `size 640 480` | `ENCYCLOE` | `size 640 480` |
| `DEMOWINE` | `size 640 480` | `WINE` | `size 640 480` |
| `DINTROE` | `size 640 480` | `WINGAMEE` | `size 640 480` |
| `DPBLANKE` | `size 640 480` | `WINUKE` | `size 640 480` |
| `DPLAYSE` | `size 640 480` | `bintroe` | `size 640 480` |
| `GETSVRE` | `size 640 480` | `introe` | `size 640 480` |
| `IPXNAMEE` | `size 640 480` | `shumane` | `size 640 480` |
| `LOADGE` | `size 640 480` | `LOBJE` | `size 112 96 304 272` |
| `LOPTE` | `size 112 128 308 240` | `LQCE` | `size 112 160 304 176` |
| `LSGE` | `size 112 48 304 386` | `MULTIE~1.TXT` (readable copy of a lobby script) | `size 640 480` |

Note the lowercase `bintroe`, `introe`, `shumane` — easy to miss on a case-insensitive listing.
Council Wars has the same set (uppercase `BINTROE`, `INTROE`, `SHUMANE`) plus three more under
`exp/intrface/`.

Keywords: `size`, `pictures`, `background`, `palette`, `text`, `font`, `font_offset`, `colour`,
`bright_pushed`, `bright_highlight`, `end`, plus per-object `pushb`, `checkb`, `in_text`,
`picture`, `list`, `scroll`, `group`, `textmsg`, each with explicit `x y w h`.

The `size` handler is `widget.c` `0x004223A8` and it accepts **two or four** numbers:

* `size W H` → rect `(0, 0, W, H)` — what the 26 full-screen scripts use
* `size X Y W H` → rect `(X, Y, W, H)` — used by the four sub-window scripts above

**Consequence: every screen can be repositioned or resized by editing one line of text, with no
binary patching at all.** Centring an existing 640×480 screen inside 1024×768 is
`size 192 144 640 480`.

### 6.1 The in-game HUD is three data files **(verified)**

This was the one part of the display assumed to be compiled in. It is not. `proto.c` loads it in
the same function that sets the map view rect (§5): `mov edx, "intrface/main"` at `0x0041EB34`,
`call load_interface` at `0x0041EB63`, handle stored in `0x004AB1C4`. `MAINE`'s own header names
the other two files:

```
size 640 480
pictures   intrface/mainbut     -> INTRFACE/MAINBUT.SPR   242 231 B, the HUD widget cell bank

`INTRFACE.GIF` is a **frame with a hole**, and the hole is exactly the map viewport derived from
the code in §5. Decoded, it is only **8.9 % opaque** (27 230 of 307 200 px); index 254 (RGB 0,0,0,
the `erase` colour) fills the rest. Over the rect `(4,6)-(515,453)` — the 512×448 viewport — it is
**99.8 % index 254** with 4 distinct colours, against 81 distinct colours outside it. The fully
opaque runs pin the frame down to the pixel:

| Opaque run | Meaning |
|---|---|
| columns `0…3` (100 %) | left border — map view starts at x = 4 |
| rows `0…5` (100 %) | top border — map view starts at y = 6 |
| columns `515…517` (100 %) | map view right edge (4 + 512 − 1 = 515) |
| columns `636…639` (100 %) | right screen border |
| rows `457…462`, `473…479` (100 %) | bottom bar detail |
| `x 516…639` overall | 24.6 % opaque — the right panel, rest filled by `MAINBUT.SPR` widgets and the engine-drawn minimap |
| `x 0…639, y 454…479` | 55.1 % opaque — the bottom bar |

`MAINE` places **163 positioned widgets** — 82 of the generic kinds (47 `pushb`, 13 `picture`,
13 `in_text`, 9 `checkb`) plus **80 `count`** (a button with a price counter: every building,
troop and upgrade in the build panel, at x = 518 / 577, y `112…358`) and **1 `scount`** (the money
counter, `#75` at (524,456)) — and 9 `group`s. The first version of this paragraph missed the two
`count` kinds, and so did `tools/hud_layout.py`; see §10.6 for what that looked like in the game.

* **156 widgets at x ≥ 516**, spanning x `516…638`, y `92…456` — the right panel. Tabs at y = 92,
  unit-order buttons from y = 153, Build button at (516, 422), money counter at (524, 456) on the
  panel's bottom corner.
* **4 widgets in the bottom bar**: `pushb #147` (4,460) 20×19, `pushb #149` (24,460) 20×19,
  `in_text #148` (50,462) 61×1, `in_text #200` (480,463) 3×1.
* **3 widgets over the map**: `picture #199` (200,160) 5×5, `in_text #203` (10,440) 72×1,
  `in_text #204` (10,425) 72×1 — the message lines.
* **y 6…90 at x 519…615 is deliberately left empty** — that is the minimap, painted by
  `engmain.c` `0x0043A064`/`0x0043A43C`, not by a widget.

So the division of labour is: the **code** fixes where the map view and minimap are rendered; the
**data** positions everything else around them.

### 6.2 The art

Fixed-size and never scaled by the engine: 19 × 640×480 `.GIF` backgrounds in `INTRFACE/`
(including the HUD frame above), the terrain `.GIF` palettes at the game root, `LOAD.BMP` and
`LOAD2.BMP` (640×480), 32 `CURSOR/cursor%d.bmp`, and the `.SPR` cell banks (§6.3).

### 6.3 The `.SPR` container format **(verified)**

Decoded from `juicel.c`. Entry points, all reached through the graphics context:

| Address | Role |
|---|---|
| `0x0042532C` | `load_sprite_bank(name, ctx)` in `animate.c` — builds `"sprites/%s"`, allocates a 20-byte bank record ("animation cell header") and calls the two below through `ctx+0x44` then `ctx+0x40` |
| `0x0044F790` | `ctx+0x44` — reads the header only, to compute the allocation size |
| `0x0044F818` | `ctx+0x40` — the parser |
| `0x0044FAC0` | raw-cell blitter |
| `0x0044FC44` | RLE-cell blitter (decode loop at `0x0044FD4F`) |
| `0x0044FE81`ff | per-cell draw dispatcher: applies the cell offsets, clips, then picks the blitter from `bank+0x0C` |

**File layout.** All integers little-endian — the loader uses plain `fread`
(`0x00406A44` = `fread(dst,2,1,f)`, `0x00406A5C` = `fread(dst,4,1,f)`), with no byte swapping.

| Offset | Size | Field |
|---|---|---|
| `0x000` | `u16` | `flags` — `flags & 0x180` means the cell bodies are RLE compressed. Only two values occur in the shipped data: `0x0001` (raw, 84 files) and `0x0081` (RLE, 468 files) |
| `0x002` | `u16` | `ncells` |
| `0x004` | `u32` | `datasize` — an allocation hint, **not** the body size (see below) |
| `0x008` | 768 | palette, 256 × (r,g,b), 6-bit VGA components (0…63) |
| `0x308` | `8·n` | directory, per cell: `u16 width`, `u16 height`, `u16 xoffset`, `u16 yoffset` |
| `0x308+8n` | — | cell bodies in order: raw = `width·height` bytes with no prefix; RLE = `u32 length` then that many bytes |

The directory therefore starts at **776**, not 779 — see the dead end recorded in §13.

**RLE scheme** (`0x0044FD4F`). A signed control byte, with the write cursor running in row-major
order and wrapping at `width`, so a transparent run may cross rows:

* `c >= 0` → the next `c + 1` bytes are literal palette indices (max run 128)
* `c < 0` → skip `-c` pixels, leaving them transparent (max skip 128)

**Palette index 0 is transparent** in both blitters (`0x0044FBEF`, `0x0044FDA0`) — including inside
a literal run, so a literal may legally carry zeros and they still read through.

**Cell `xoffset`/`yoffset`** are draw offsets added to the requested position by the dispatcher at
`0x0044FE9A` and `0x0044FEA2`. Every cell in the shipped data is tightly cropped (no empty
margins), so these are the trim offsets that put a cropped cell back where it belongs in its
logical frame. `SPRITES/ACAR.SPR` shows it plainly: constant height 227, widths 15/32/33/66/82…
with offsets 54/36/36/36/20… so that `width + xoffset` is constant within a facing group.

**The `datasize` quirk.** For RLE files it is the sum of the per-cell stream lengths. For raw files
the stored value counts an extra 12 bytes per cell — the 8-byte directory entry plus a notional
4-byte length prefix that raw files do not actually store — which is why the loader does
`datasize -= ncells*4` at `0x0044F88B` and then over-allocates by `ncells*24` (24 = the in-memory
cell header size, from `0x0044F7FF`). Nothing else depends on the value, so a writer can simply
recompute it.

**Validation.** All **552** unique `.SPR` files in `DC - Classic`, `DC - Council wars` (including
`exp/`) and the map editor parse byte-exact, with no trailing bytes: 17 958 cells, of which 52 are
`0x0` placeholders and 15 088 are non-empty compressed cells. Every one of those 15 088 decodes to
exactly `width·height` pixels while consuming exactly its declared stream length. Re-encoding and
decoding again reproduces the pixels for **15 088 / 15 088** cells; the re-encoded stream is
byte-identical to the original for 55.2 % of cells and never larger (0.4 % smaller in total, so the
original packer was marginally suboptimal). **337 of the 552 files (61.1 %) rebuild
byte-identically** from the parsed representation — `INTRFACE/MAINBUT.SPR` among them, same MD5.

**Tooling.** `tools/spr.py` implements the codec: `info`, `extract` (one PNG per cell plus a
`cells.json` carrying flags, palette and the per-cell offsets), `build` (rebuild from that
directory) and `check` (parse plus round-trip self-test). This is what unblocks re-importing traced
artwork in §10 stage 5.

**Cell size limits.** `engmain.c` asserts `sprite->xsize > 0 && xsize < 512 && ysize > 0 &&
ysize < 512` (string at `DGROUP 0x00486274`), but the shipped data contains **60 cells with a
dimension ≥ 512** (largest 640×257), so that path clearly is not reached for every cell. Treat
512 as the safe ceiling for anything drawn through `engmain.c`.

`ANIMATE/*.FIN` is a **different container** — loaded via `"animate/%s"` (`animate.c`
`0x00425613`), and its header does not fit the layout above (its `flags` word reads `0x001D`).
It is not covered here.

## 7. Mouse and movies **(verified)**

**Mouse** (`mouse.c`). Two paths, both clamping to the screen:

* `0x00450E20`ff (absolute): clamps to `[0, 639] × [0, 479]`, stores to `0x0048C164/68`.
* `0x00450E80` (DirectInput `GetDeviceState`, relative): accumulates into
  `0x005327C0`/`0x005327C4`, clamps to `[0, 639] × [0, 479]`, mirrors into `0x004DFF14` /
  `0x004DFF1C`, which is the position the cursor blit and every hit test use.
* `win_init` seeds `0x004DFF14/1C` with (320, 240) — the screen centre.
* The cursor sprite is blitted with `IDirectDrawSurface::BltFast` from one of the 32 cursor
  surfaces and clipped by hand against 640×480 at `0x0042E1D2`…`0x0042E219`.

**Movies** (`avi.c`, `AVIFIL32` + `MSVFW32`). Source frames are **320×240** (`0x0040722B`,
`0x004074B1`, `0x0040762B`, `0x00407E14`) written into their own DirectDraw surface
(`0x00488E00`) with a hardcoded **320-pixel** stride (`add edx, 0x280` = 640 bytes,
`0x004074C2`) and a 180-row clear (`0x004074C8`) — i.e. some clips are letterboxed 320×180.
`avi_begin` `0x00406FD0` releases the game surfaces; `avi_end` `0x00406FF0` does
`SetDisplayMode(640,480,8)` → `SetDisplayMode(640,480,16)` → `create_surfaces`, a deliberate mode
cycle, so **both** mode setters are live. The back buffer is cleared directly at `0x004073C4`
with a hardcoded 640×480 extent and a **1280-byte row pitch** (`add ecx, 0x500`, `0x00407405`).

## 8. Complete inventory of resolution-dependent sites

Verified by disassembly and byte-checked in the file. `ENGEXP16.EXE` offsets were located by
relocation-tolerant byte matching and, for the sites of these tables, resolve to a single shift:
**`ENGEXP16 = Classic + 0x60` in `AUTO` from `0x6000` onward, `+0` below it, `+0x228` in
`DGROUP` *file* offsets** (98.3 % of `AUTO 0x7000…0x50000` is byte-identical at that shift).
The rule is not exact everywhere: §10.10 has the complete delta map of the code section (a
`−0x20` stretch in `main.c` that holds two menu-furniture sites), the distinction between the
`+0x228` file shift and the `+0x28` *virtual-address* shift of the DGROUP data the code names, and
the one site whose stock value differs. `tools/patch_resolution.py` carries all of that in its
`BUILDS` table.

Council Wars `dc16.exe` is a different build; only the §3 anchor is given for it.

The last two rows are a *viewport* constant (512 = the stock map view width), not a screen one;
they were found by symptom in the first visual test (§10.6), not by the sweep. Two further
families are tabulated in their own sections: the 44 menu-furniture coordinates (`main.c`,
§10.7 — 640×480 *positions*, moved with the letterboxed scripts) and the movie path (`avi.c`,
§10.8 — ten sites, three of them code rewrites rather than constants).

### 8.2 Hidden multiplies — the trap

Watcom strength-reduced `× 640` and `× 1280` into `(y*4 + y) << n`, so **searching the
disassembly for `280h` finds only 17 sites and misses these three entirely**:

| Site | Classic VA | Classic file | Bytes | ENGEXP16 file | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| `driver.c` `y*640` | `0x0042C213` + `0x0042C218` | `0x2B613`, `0x2B618` | `01 CA` … `C1 E2 07` | `0x2B673`, `0x2B678` | `edx = (y*4 + y) << 7` |
| `engmain.c` `y*1280` (bytes) | `0x004360B9` + `0x004360BE` | `0x354B9`, `0x354BE` | `01 F8` … `C1 E0 08` | `0x35519`, `0x3551E` | `eax = (y*4 + y) << 8` |
| `engmain.c` `y*640` | `0x004363BD` + `0x004363C5` | `0x357BD`, `0x357C5` | `01 C8` … `C1 E0 07` | `0x3581D`, `0x35825` | `eax = (y*4 + y) << 7` |

A full sweep for `shl reg, 4…12` preceded by a `×3`/`×5` idiom found no other framebuffer strides;
the remaining hits are struct strides (`×96`, `×160`, `×192`, `×384`, `×1600`), the minimap grid
row stride (`×384` = 96 × 4), signed-divide idioms and percentage scaling.

### 8.3 Not verified / still open

* `0x0044EF15` (`gifload.c`): an 8-bit writer with a hardcoded **320**-pixel stride over a
  16-iteration loop, using the shade LUT at `0x0048C188`. Purpose not identified. Must be read
  before trusting a non-640 mode.
* `driver.c` `0x0042BCCE`, `0x0042BEFE`, `0x0042BFC1`, `0x0042C146` were not decoded individually;
  `0x0042BCEE` loads `0x4B000` (= 640·480) into `esi`, so at least one of them is a full-screen
  pass that needs the same treatment as `clear_screen`.
* The two dwords `0x14F`, `0x16E` at `DGROUP 0x00488DAC/B0` were not identified.
* Nothing here was re-verified in Council Wars `dc16.exe`.

## 9. Target geometry for 1024×768

**Why 1024 and not 800.** `1024 = 2^10`, so every `y * width` becomes a single shift. The three
hidden multiplies of §8.2 then need only a *length-preserving* two-instruction edit — neutralise
the `+ y` and bump the shift by one:

| Site | From | To | Result |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x0042C213` / `0x0042C218` | `01 CA` / `C1 E2 07` | `89 D2` / `C1 E2 08` | `(y*4) << 8 = y*1024` |
| `0x004363BD` / `0x004363C5` | `01 C8` / `C1 E0 07` | `89 C0` / `C1 E0 08` | `(y*4) << 8 = y*1024` |
| `0x004360B9` / `0x004360BE` | `01 F8` / `C1 E0 08` | `89 C0` / `C1 E0 09` | `(y*4) << 9 = y*2048` B |

(`89 D2` = `mov edx,edx`, `89 C0` = `mov eax,eax` — two-byte no-ops, so no NOP sleds, no shifted
code, and no risk of landing inside a jump target.) With 800 pixels each of these would need a
real `imul` or a longer sequence and therefore code relocation. Recommend **1024×768** and treat
800×600 as out of scope.

**Layout.** Keep the HUD chrome at its native pixel size and spend all the new space on the map
view. Current chrome is 124 px on the right and 26 px at the bottom, with a 4/6 px inset:

| | 640×480 (now) | 1024×768 (target) |
|---|---|---|
| screen | 640 × 480 | 1024 × 768 |
| map viewport | 512 × 448 = 16 × 14 tiles | **896 × 736 = 28 × 23 tiles** |
| map view rect | (4, 6, 512, 448) | (4, 6, 896, 736) |
| occlusion mask | `0x7000` (512·448/8) | **`0x14200`** (896·736/8 = 82 432) |
| minimap | 96 × 84 at (519, 6) | 96 × 84 at (903, 6), origin byte `0x370E` |
| clear loop count | `0x4B000` | **`0xC0000`** (1024·768) |
| avi row pitch | `0x500` | **`0x800`** |
| mouse clamp | 639 / 479 | **1023 / 767** (`0x3FF` / `0x2FF`) |
| mouse centre | 320 / 240 | **512 / 384** (`0x200` / `0x180`) |

896 and 736 are both exact multiples of 32, so no partial tile row or column is introduced. The
minimap origin is `(6 * 1024 + 903) * 2 = 0x370E`.

**What this does *not* do.** Nothing is scaled. Sprites, fonts, buttons, the HUD and every menu
background stay at their 640×480 pixel size, so at 1024×768 they occupy proportionally less of the
screen and the panel art has 288 px of empty space below it. Fixing that is art work (§10 stage
5), not patching.

---

## 10. Staged plan

Each stage ends in a runnable binary, so a regression can be bisected to one stage. Every stage
is mirrored in `ENGEXP16.EXE` by `patch_resolution.py`'s `BUILDS` table (the `+0x60` rule of §8
plus the fixups of §10.10), and the expected-byte check re-verifies every site before writing.

### Stage 0 — reproducible patching (done)

The two CD patches so far were single-byte edits recorded only in the commit history. Sixty-odd
multi-byte edits across two binaries need a script, so `tools/patch_resolution.py` is that script
and **it, not §8, is now the authoritative copy of the site table**. It

* takes `--width`/`--height` and a `--stage` (1…4, cumulative, matching the stages below), plus
  `--viewport WxH` to force the map view smaller than the screen allows and `--exclude SUBSTR` to
  drop individual sites — the two flags that made the §10.3 bisection possible;
* locates the globals by the **4-byte** prefix `4F 01 6E 01` of the §3 anchor — deliberately not
  the full 12-byte sequence, because that contains the dimensions and so stops matching the moment
  the file is patched, which would break `verify`. The 4-byte prefix is unique in all three stock
  builds *and* in a patched one;
* identifies the build by MD5, and derives `ENGEXP16` offsets with the `+0x60` rule and the
  per-build fixups of §10.10 (`BUILDS`);
* applies each site as `(file_offset, expected_bytes, new_bytes)` and **refuses to write unless
  every selected site still holds its expected bytes** — that check is what makes relying on the
  shift rule safe rather than a guess, and it makes a double-apply or a wrong build fail loudly;
* keeps instruction lengths identical at every site, so no code moves and no jump target shifts;
* writes a `.bak` (and never overwrites an existing one, which is assumed to be pristine).

Three commands: `verify` reports a binary's state — for a patched file it reads the geometry back
out of the globals and tallies, per stage, how many sites are patched / stock / unrecognised, which
is what makes the staged bisection below usable. `plan` prints every edit and writes nothing.
`apply` patches, then prints the data and art work that is left.

Verified end to end: **66** edits on Classic and 66 on `ENGEXP16` (64 code sites plus the two
globals), cumulatively 20 / 42 / 63 / 66 at stages 1 / 2 / 3 / 4; `--stage 1` applies 20 and
`verify` then correctly reports stages 2–4 as untouched;
re-applying is refused; the `.bak` is byte-identical to the original; and the three rewritten
multiply sequences were re-disassembled out of the patched binary to confirm they read

```
0042C213: 89 D2   mov edx,edx        0042C218: C1 E2 08   shl edx,8     ; y*1024
004363BD: 89 C0   mov eax,eax        004363C5: C1 E0 08   shl eax,8     ; y*1024
004360B9: 89 C0   mov eax,eax        004360BE: C1 E0 09   shl eax,9     ; y*1024*2 bytes
```

with every following instruction still at its original address. The optional-header `CheckSum` of
these binaries is `0`, so there is nothing to recompute after patching.

### Stage 1 — prove the display mode (letterbox)

Patch only: the two globals (§3), both `SetDisplayMode` calls, the offscreen surface size, the
clear-loop count, the `driver.c` clip rect, and the three hidden multiplies of §9.

Leave the map viewport, the minimap, the HUD rect, the mouse clamps and all art alone. Expected
result: a 1024×768 framebuffer with the game drawn in its top-left 640×480 corner and the rest
black or garbage. What this proves: that DirectDraw gives us a 1024×768×16 exclusive-fullscreen
flip chain on the target machines, that `pitch == width * 2` still holds for the system-memory
offscreen surface, and that the blitters follow `screen->width` as advertised.

**Watch for:** neither `set_mode_16` nor `create_surfaces` has a fallback if 16-bit at the new size
is refused — they print an error and abort. If a machine refuses RGB565 at 1024×768 there is no
second chance in the code.

**Result, run 9 Sep 2026 on Windows 11 (1280×800 desktop).** Stage 1 applied to a copy of
Classic `dc16.exe` (20 edits), launched from `DC - Classic/`:

* the mode was granted — `PrimaryScreen.Bounds` read **1024×768** while the game ran, and the
  desktop was restored on exit;
* the process ran stably for the whole 20 s observation, no assert, `error.log` stayed empty;
* `pitch == width * 2` holds and the blitters do follow `screen->width`: the loading screen, the
  intro movie, the `DC` logo, the title, the credits and the whole button grid rendered sharp and
  at their correct coordinates in the top-left 640×480. A wrong stride would have sheared every
  one of them diagonally;
* the 640×480 loading screen and the letterboxed intro AVI sat in the top-left corner on black,
  exactly as intended for this stage.

One real defect surfaced, which is what the stage exists for — §10.1 below.

#### 10.1 Full-screen `.GIF` backgrounds skew, and centring is three edits **(verified)**

The main menu came up with its logo, title and buttons correct but its **background** wrecked: the
Mars limb gone, replaced by diagonal red streaks, and the starfield smeared across the full
1024 px width. Captured side by side with the stock binary at 640×480, which is clean, so this is
new and not the menu's own animated interference.

Cause, read out of `gifload.c`: the GIF LZW decoder `0x0044EB7C` writes **straight into the locked
16-bit framebuffer** (`esi = screen->pixels`, colours through `screen->LUT + 0x602`), and its
output loop has **no row-stride advance at all** — `add esi,2` per pixel at
`0x0044ECC5`/`0x0044ECCE`, and `add esi,length*2` for a multi-pixel LZW string at `0x0044ECF4`. It
streams the whole image as one linear run, which is correct only while
`image width == framebuffer stride`. Give a 640-wide GIF a 1024-stride framebuffer and every row
lands 384 px early, so the picture shears left and compresses vertically by 640/1024.

**There is no constant to patch here.** The stride is not wrong, it is absent. And the blit takes
no destination origin either — `esi = screen->pixels` at `0x0044EB89`, nothing added — so a
background always lands at framebuffer (0,0) whatever the script's `size` line says.

Those two facts together give one hard rule: **a full-screen background must be a file whose
dimensions are exactly the framebuffer size.** Nothing else can be made to work without changing
code.

This matters for every screen, because all **26** full-screen scripts have a `background` line —
checked, not sampled — drawing one of **19 distinct 640×480 `.GIF`s** (`choo`, `ency`, `gtsux`,
`intrface`, `intrg`, `intro`, `loader`, `lost`, `multiwin`, `name`, `net`, `server`, `shuman`,
`story`, `tcpwait`, `victorg`, `victory`, `wingame`, plus `general`, which has no `.GIF` and is
drawn from sprites). The only scripts *without* a background are the four sub-window dialogs
`LOBJE`, `LOPTE`, `LQCE`, `LSGE`, and those already use the `size X Y W H` form and are correctly
placed as they stand.

##### `size X Y W H` does not move the widgets **(verified)**

A second fact, learned the hard way by padding one GIF and launching: the four-argument `size`
form sets the window's **bounds rect only**. Widget `x`/`y` are **absolute screen coordinates** and
are not offset by it. `NEWGAMEE`'s `checkb 0` sits at (193,23) in the script and renders at
(193,23) whatever the `size` line says. The shipped four-argument scripts mislead on this point:
`LOPTE` declares `size 112 128 308 240` and its first `picture` is at (112,128), which looks like
rect-relative addressing but is simply a coordinate that already agrees with the rect.

So letterboxing a screen is **three coupled edits**, which is why they belong in one tool:

1. repack the background GIF onto a framebuffer-sized canvas with the original content centred;
2. set the script's `size` to `X Y w h` so the bounds rect covers where the content now is;
3. add the same `(X, Y)` to **every** positioned widget's `x` and `y`.

`tools/pad_background.py` does all three (`plan` / `apply` / `revert`, `.bak` per file, idempotent,
and it refuses to write a GIF whose byte layout would desynchronise the game's parser — no
extension blocks, GIF87a and the 256-entry global colour table preserved). It deliberately skips
`MAINE`: padding the HUD would keep the map viewport at 512×448, which is the opposite of the
point.

##### Two routes, neither needing a code patch

**Route A — pad.** Letterbox the 17 menu backgrounds that have a `.GIF`, and shift their widgets.
Pure data, no artwork, fully reversible. Gives a pixel-correct 640×480 UI inside a 1024×768
screen. **Tested 9 Sep 2026**: applied to all 24 menu scripts, then launched a stage-2 build. The
network-options screen (`NETOPTE`) rendered exactly as intended — background sharp, unskewed and
centred at (192,144), every widget aligned with the artwork, clean black border, cursor tracking.

**Route B — repaint.** Redraw the backgrounds at 1024×768 and set each script to `size 1024 768`
with its widgets repositioned for the larger canvas. More work, and it is **required regardless**
for `INTRFACE.GIF`, because only a genuinely redrawn HUD frame can carry the 896×736 hole that
buys the bigger battlefield (stage 5).

An earlier draft of this section proposed injecting a row stride and a destination origin into the
decoder via a code cave. **That is not needed.** Both routes above satisfy the hard rule by making
the file the right size, and the existing linear write is then correct as it stands.

##### Caveat: code-positioned elements do not move

Route A shifts widgets, but some screen furniture is placed by code and stays where it is. On the
network screen the spinning globe (`intrface/blew`; `NETOPTE` never mentions it — the
`globeg`/`globes` pair loaded at `0x0040323A`/`0x0040325D` is the *briefing* screen's globe)
keeps its hardcoded position, and once the buttons move +192 it overlaps them — its opaque
bounding box blanks the right half of the `TCP/IP` and `IPX NETWORK` labels. The intro AVI is the
same class of thing, still letterboxed at the top left until stage 4. **Enumerated and fixed in
§10.7 (44 immediates, two primitives) and §10.8 (movies).**

### Stage 2 — full-screen chrome, menus centred

* Mouse clamps and centre → 1023/767, 512/384.
* Cursor clip → 1024/768.
* `main.c` full-screen rect → 1023/767.
* Loading screens: the `LoadImageA` and `BitBlt` calls take the new numbers (stage 2 sites), and
  `INTRFACE/LOAD.BMP` / `LOAD2.BMP` are **padded** to 1024×768 with the picture centred
  (`pad_background.py apply` does it alongside the GIFs). Two things ruled out the alternatives,
  found when the tester reported the stretched result "must be the original image": `LoadImageA`
  with a non-zero `cxDesired`/`cyDesired` *scales* a 640×480 file to 1024×768, so leaving the art
  alone gives a blocky stretch; and the `BitBlt` destination at `0x0042EFF7`/`0x0042EFF9` is two
  `push 0` **imm8** bytes (`6A 00`), so it cannot be moved to (192,144) with a same-length edit —
  192 and 144 do not fit a signed byte, and neither do −192/−144 as a source offset.
* Menus: edit one line per `INTRFACE/*E` script (§6) from `size 640 480` to
  `size 192 144 640 480`. This centres every menu, lobby and dialog with **no patching**. The
  in-game map view is positioned separately (`proto.c`, stage 3) and is unaffected.
  **Not a one-line edit** — the rect does not move the widgets and the background ignores it
  entirely (§10.1). Use `tools/pad_background.py`, which pads the GIF, sets the rect and shifts
  every widget together; or repaint at 1024×768 and use `size 1024 768` with repositioned
  widgets.

At the end of stage 2 the game is a genuine 1024×768 application: under route A a pixel-correct
640×480 UI boxed in the middle, under route B a native 1024×768 one. Either is a usable state and
a sensible place to stop if the rest stalls, bar the code-positioned elements noted in §10.1.

#### 10.2 A tile count encoded twice, the second time as an `lea` displacement **(verified)**

Stage 3 as first shipped crashed the moment a battle started: access violation, `0xC0000005`,
fault RVA `0x39D5E` = VA **`0x00439D5E`**, in the per-tile vision scan in `engmain.c`. That
instruction is `mov edx,[eax]`, dereferencing a ground-layer row pointer taken from
`[map+0x804 + i*4]`.

`clip_view_to_map` `0x00435E24` builds the scanned rect from the map's **bottom** edge:

```
00435E3F  mov  eax,[map+0x9A4B4]   ; map height in tiles
00435E45  sub  eax,edx             ;   - view_tile_y
00435E47  mov  ecx,0Eh             ; tiles_down = 14      <- patched to 23
00435E4C  lea  edx,[eax-0Eh]       ; y origin, 14 AGAIN   <- MISSED
00435E4F  mov  ebx,10h             ; tiles_across = 16    <- patched to 28
00435E62  call make_rect(x, y, w, h)
```

The count appears **twice**: once as `mov r32, imm32` and once as a **signed 8-bit `lea`
displacement**, `8D 50 F2`. Patching only the first left the rect 9 tiles too tall, so the scan
walked past the 256-entry row-pointer table, picked up a word of path-grid data as a pointer, and
faulted. Fix: `8D 50 F2` -> `8D 50 E9`, one byte, now site `0x3524C` in `patch_resolution.py`,
the first of nine sites the crash hunt added (57 → 66).

**The lesson generalises.** §8.2 records that Watcom hides `*640` in strength-reduced form; this is
a second hiding place — *small* constants encoded as `imm8` or `disp8`, which no search for the
`imm32` form can find. A targeted sweep of the render modules for 14 as an `imm8`/`disp8` afterwards
turned up no other instance (the other `[ebp-0Eh]` hits are stack locals), and the width has no
such partner because the x origin is not measured from the far edge. But the same check is owed to
any future constant: **look for the small encodings too, and prefer a diagnostic over a sweep** —
the Windows Error Reporting fault offset named the faulting instruction exactly and cost one
lookup, where auditing the 80-odd map-dimension references would have cost an afternoon.

`Geometry` now refuses a viewport taller than 127 tiles, since that displacement is a signed byte.

### Stage 3 — enlarge the map viewport **(done — 28×23 tiles run; §10.5 grows the lightmap frame)**

* `engmain.c` viewport 512 → 896, 448 → 736; tiles 16 → 28, 14 → 23.
* Occlusion mask `0x7000` → `0x14200`.
* Render dest stride 640 → 1024.
* `proto.c` map view rect 512 → 896, 448 → 736 (keep x=4, y=6).
* Minimap origin `0x220E` → `0x370E`, both strides 640 → 1024.
* `lighting.c` lightplane fill: the 31 per-row advances `0x200` → 896 (§10.6).

The lightplane *allocation* and its stride variable follow automatically (§5); the fill loop's
row advance does not, and was the "repetitive black lines" of the first visual test (§10.6).

Then re-derive, from the disassembly, everything the terrain and object renderers clamp against.
`0x00435E24` (clip view to map) builds `make_rect(view_x>>5, map_h - (view_y>>5) - 14, 16, 14)`
from the same two tile counts, so those two immediates look like they cover the scroll clamp as
well — but that must be confirmed, together with `lighting.c` `0x00453910` and `sprite.c`
`0x004543FC`, before declaring the stage done.

**Consequence to accept:** a 28×23-tile view on a 256×256-tile map shows 2.9× the area. This is
render-side only — the lockstep checksum (`sync.c`, `DC16_BATTLE_ENGINE.md` §16) covers simulation
state and not the camera, and the relay server (`Dark-Colony-Server`) never sees viewport data — so
it does not desync. It *is* a competitive change if a patched and an unpatched client meet in the
same game.

#### 10.3 Stage 3 does **not** work above ~20×16 tiles — how the cause was narrowed **(verified)**

> **Resolved in §10.4.** The buffer is `draw_terrain`'s own stack lightmap, and there are two caps,
> not one. Read this section for the method; §10.4 has the answer and corrects the 640×512
> recommendation made below.

With the §10.2 `lea` fix in place, a full-size 896×736 viewport (28×23 tiles) still dies, now in a
different place: access violation reading address 0, faulting instruction

```
00453ad4  8b36    mov esi,dword ptr [esi]
```

inside `draw_terrain` `0x00453910` (`lighting.c`). It reproduces **without entering a battle** —
the attract-mode demo starts itself after ~20 s at the main menu and renders terrain — which is
what made it cheap to bisect.

##### It is a capacity threshold, not arithmetic

`patch_resolution.py` grew a `--viewport WxH` flag for this: it forces the map view smaller than
the screen allows, so the viewport can be swept independently of the 1024×768 framebuffer. (The
HUD frame then does not match the hole, which is irrelevant to a crash test.) Sweeping it:

| `--viewport` | tiles | occlusion mask | result |
|---|---|---|---|
| 544×480 | 17×15 | `0x7F80` | runs |
| 640×512 | 20×16 | `0xA000` | runs |
| 768×608 | 24×19 | `0xE400` | **crashes** |
| 896×736 | 28×23 | `0x14200` | **crashes** |

Every one of those builds computes its constants through the same `Geometry` code, so a wrong
formula would fail at 17×15 too. Controls: stage 2 alone ran 45 s clean; stage 3 with the
enlargement sites excluded ran 50 s clean. So the arithmetic is right and something has a fixed
capacity that 20×16 fits and 24×19 does not.

##### The register capture names a single corrupted local

Three runs under `cdb` (`x86\cdb.exe` out of the WinDbg store package) at 896×736 gave consistent
registers at the fault:

* run 1: `eax = 0x11` (17), `esi = 0x44`
* run 2: `eax = 0x49` (73), `esi = 0x124`

The address being dereferenced is built as `esi = (index << 2) + [ebp+0x56]`, and `17 << 2 = 0x44`,
`73 << 2 = 0x124`. **`[ebp+0x56]` reads 0 in both runs.** It should hold the ground-layer
row-pointer table base, `[view+0x14] + 0x804` — the same table §10.2 was walking off the end of.

Everything around it is intact, checked in the same runs:

| Location | Value | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `[ebp+0x56]` | **`0`** | row-pointer table base — should be `0x0356CC12` |
| `[ebp+0x5A]` | `0x10` | light level |
| `[ebp+0x5E]` | `0` | view tile y |
| `[ebp+0x62]` | `97` | view tile x |
| `[ebp+0x6A]` | `23` | tiles down |
| `[ebp+0x6E]` | `28` | tiles across |
| `[ebp+0x72]` | `13` | — |
| `0x005044B8` | `0x02E00380` | viewport `896×736` |
| `0x005044BC` | `0x400` | dest stride 1024 |
| `0x005044C0` | `0x0356C40E` | map pointer, valid; map is **128×112** tiles |

So the tile rect is legal on this map — `97 + 28 = 125 ≤ 128`, `0 + 23 = 23 ≤ 112` — and the view
struct §5 describes is correct in every field. `ebp = 0x000EF72E`, `esp = 0x000EE2DC`,
`ebp - esp = 0x1452`, exactly the frame size the prologue reserves, so the stack pointer is not
blown either. **Exactly one local is zeroed while its immediate neighbours survive**, which is the
signature of a bounded write into a fixed-size buffer that happens to end at `ebp+0x56`.

##### Buffers ruled out as the overflowing one

Each of these was read out of the disassembly and either scales with the viewport or is indexed by
something unrelated to it:

* `draw_objects` `0x004543FC` sort array at `ebp-0xCB4` — 804 dwords, sized for the 800-object
  pool, not for screen area;
* the static render-item list at `0x004F6F2C` — capacity 800, and it is *guarded*:
  `cmp dword ptr [0x005044E4],320h` at `0x0043613E` refuses to add beyond 800;
* `tilememory` at `0x4260` — 1416 × 12 bytes, indexed by tile *type*;
* the occlusion mask and the lightplane — both allocated from the viewport size (§5), and neither
  has a hardcoded row stride to miss;
* `draw_terrain`'s own frame — no viewport-indexed array found in it.

The camera path was also verified end to end and is **not** the cause: bounds are written at
`0x0041EE66` / `0x0041EE6F` into `ui+0x114…0x120` (`ui` base `0x004AA9D0`), enforced by the
generic `clamp2d` `0x00436668(min_x, min_y, max_x, max_y, &x, &y)` called from `0x0040AF16`, and
the view origin is derived with the same half-viewport constants the patcher already rewrites at
`0x0040AB1C` / `0x0040AB2B` and `0x0040B0BC` / `0x0040B0E0`. An earlier draft called those camera
globals dead stores; that was a bad grep (the pattern needed the trailing `h` of `[004AAAE4h]`) and
is retracted — they are read.

##### What was left — and how it was closed

One question remained: **what writes 0 to `[ebp+0x56]`, and why only above 20×16 tiles.** §10.4
answers it. The step that got there was a hardware watchpoint on that dword — under `cdb`, armed *from the breakpoint's own
command list* so that it is set with the frame established:

```
bp dc16+0x5393d "r ebp;dd ebp+0x56 L1;ba w2 ebp+0x56;ba w2 ebp+0x58;bc 0;g"
g
```

Two invocation details cost a run each and are worth recording: queued `-c` commands are mangled
by shell quoting, so use `-cf <file>`; and `cdb` needs the full path to the target plus
`-WorkingDirectory`, or it cannot find it. A third: `ba w4` is rejected with *"Data breakpoint
must be aligned"* whenever the computed address is not 4-byte aligned, which `ebp+0x56` is not for
every `ebp` — two `ba w2` breakpoints covering the dword avoid the problem entirely.

##### ~~Meanwhile: 640×512 is a shippable middle~~ — **retracted, see §10.4**

This section recommended `--stage 3 --viewport 640x512` (20×16 tiles, 1.46× the stock area) as a
releasable state. **It is not one.** §10.4 shows a second, *silent* cap at 17 tiles across: 20×16
does not crash, but it lights part of the view from the wrong neighbours. The largest viewport
correct on both caps is **17×16 = 544×512**, 1.24× stock. The map-dependence caveat still stands —
nothing here has been exercised outside the attract-mode demo map (128×112 tiles).

#### 10.4 The buffer, found: `draw_terrain`'s stack lightmap **(verified, watchpoint)**

A hardware watchpoint on `[ebp+0x56]` named the writer in one run. It is **`draw_terrain` itself**,
at the back-edge of its own first loop:

```
00453B01  lea eax,[ecx+ecx]              ; 2*ecx
00453B04  lea esi,[eax+2]                ; 2*ecx + 2
00453B07  lea eax,[esi*8]                ;  \
00453B0E  add eax,esi                    ;   >  eax = 144 * (2*ecx + 2)
00453B10  shl eax,4                      ;  /
00453B13  lea esi,[edx*8]
00453B1A  add eax,esi                    ; + 8*edx
00453B1C  mov esi,[ebp+5Ah]              ; the light value
00453B20  mov [eax+ebp-144Ah],esi        ; <-- the overflowing store
00453B27  jmp 00453A5C
```

The capture: `ecx = 0x11` (17), `edx = 0x0D` after its `inc`, so `eax = 144*36 + 8*12 = 0x14A0`,
and `ebp - 0x144A + 0x14A0` = **`ebp + 0x56`** — the corrupted local, to the byte. `[ebp+0x56]` read
`0x0352CC12` at the top of the function and `0` at the fault, with the store at `0x00453B20` the
only write in between.

##### What the array is

A **half-tile-resolution lightmap on the stack**: dwords, **4 bytes per half-tile column, 144 bytes
per half-tile row**, based at `ebp-0x1456`. Loop 1 (`0x00453A40`) fills the even half-rows from the
per-tile light values; loop 2 (`0x00453B32`) interpolates the odd half-rows from its two neighbours
(`0x00453B7A`…`0x00453B91` sum four corners, `sar edi,2` averages, `0x00453BB3` stores). Later
passes read it through the same four bases. Ten sites in all, at four displacements — `-0x1456`,
`-0x1452`, `-0x144E`, `-0x144A`, which are columns −1, 0, +1, +2 from the base `[ebp-0x1452]`
(= `esp` after the prologue) — and the ×144 row-stride idiom (`lea r,[s*8]; add r,s; shl r,4`)
appears at **6** sites, all between `0x00453B07` and `0x00453C25`. (~~42~~ — that earlier count
took every `shl reg,4` in the function; the other 34 are the `shl 4; add; shl 5` = ×544
lighting-palette index and never touch the array. Corrected in §10.5.)

The frame is `sub esp,0x14CC` with `sub ebp,7Ah`, so `esp = ebp-0x1452` and the array runs
**upward** from just above `esp` toward the locals, the lowest of which is `[ebp+0x2E]`. That gives
`0x144A + 0x2E = 5240` bytes of room. Hence two independent caps:

| Cap | Comes from | Limit | Symptom when exceeded |
|---|---|---|---|
| ~~**Width**~~ | ~~the 144-byte row stride: `4*(2*ta+2) <= 144`~~ | ~~**`tiles_across <= 17`**~~ | ~~rows bleed into each other — wrong lighting, silently~~ **Retracted in §10.5: the overflow lands only on cells of the opposite parity, which nothing uses. The stride is correct up to 34 across.** |
| **Height** | total room: `144*(2*td+2) + 8*ta <= 5240` | **`tiles_down <= 16`** | the store walks past the array into the locals — **crash** |

Stock 16×14 fits with almost nothing to spare (`34 <= 36` half-columns), which is the signature
of an array sized for exactly one screen size. The "height" cap is really a *room* cap — it is
the total footprint, `144*(2*td+2) + 4*(2*ta+2) + 4` bytes, that must stay below the locals.

The height cap reproduces the §10.3 bisection exactly, and is the whole explanation of it:

| viewport | tiles | `144*(2*td+2) + 8*ta` | vs 5240 | observed |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 544×480 | 17×15 | 4744 | fits | runs |
| 640×512 | 20×16 | 5056 | fits | runs |
| 768×608 | 24×19 | 5952 | **over** | crashes |
| 896×736 | 28×23 | 7136 | **over** | crashes |

##### ~~Correction to §10.3 and to the README~~ — itself retracted, see §10.5

§10.3 offered 640×512 (20×16) as a clean "shippable middle". This section then called that wrong
because 20 across exceeds the supposed *width* cap of 17 and would light part of the view from the
wrong neighbours. **§10.5 shows the width cap does not exist**: the overflowing columns alias cells
that the algorithm never uses. 20×16 was fine after all, and so is anything up to 34 across whose
total footprint fits. The 17×16 figure below is superseded.

##### The fix, and its real cost — **as first estimated; §10.5 has what was actually needed**

Two independent edits, both mechanical, both length-preserving:

1. **Height** — move the array base down and grow the frame: `sub esp,14CCh` → a larger `imm32`
   (still 6 bytes), and subtract the same delta from all **10** disp32 array bases (each already a
   7-byte `mov [reg+ebp+disp32]`). For 28×23 the store needs `144*48 + 224 = 7136` bytes, so the
   delta is `0x780` and the frame becomes `0x1C4C` — about 7 KB on a 1 MB stack.
2. **Width** — raise the row stride from 144 to 256 bytes, which turns the ×144 idiom into a single
   `shl reg,8`. The three-instruction sequence is 12 bytes and `shl reg,8` is 3, so it fits with
   `nop` padding and nothing moves. 256 B/row = 64 half-columns = **30 tiles across**. This is the
   expensive half: **42 sites**, and each must be confirmed to be the row stride and not some other
   ×16.

With both applied the array is `144→256` × `(2*td+3)` rows; for 28×23 that is 12 544 bytes, so the
frame goes to roughly `0x3200`. Worth doing as its own stage with its own bisection, since 42 hand-
checked sites is exactly the kind of sweep §10.2 warns about.

##### Method note

The three earlier "prologue breakpoint" runs did nothing: **`bp dc16+0x5393d` makes cdb evaluate
`dc16` as the hex number `0xDC16`**, so the breakpoint went to `0xDC16 + 0x5393D = 0x61553` and
failed to insert with `Win32 error 0n998`, while `g` returned immediately. Their fault registers
were still valid — the process simply ran unbroken to the crash. Use the absolute VA (`bp 0045393d`;
the image loads at its preferred `0x00400000`, confirmed with `lm m dc16`). To keep the log readable,
filter the legitimate writer inside the watchpoint command, remembering that a data breakpoint
reports the instruction **after** the write:

```
bp 0045393d
g
bc 0
ba w2 ebp+0x56 ".if (@eip != 0x0045393d) { .echo CULPRIT; r; kb }; gc"
g
```

#### 10.5 The lightmap frame grown: 28×23 tiles run **(verified, breakpoint)**

Applied and launched 9 Sep 2026. The full 896×736 viewport (28×23 tiles) renders terrain and the
game runs until killed; the crash of §10.3 is gone. Two runs, 60 s and 77 s, on the attract-mode
demo map, both clean. The second run carried a one-shot breakpoint at `0x004539DD` (just after
the tile counts are stored) which logged:

```
esp=001adb6c ebp=001af72e        ebp-esp = 0x1BC2  (= 0x1C3C - 0x7A: the grown frame)
[ebp+0x6A] = 0x17 (23 down)   [ebp+0x6E] = 0x1C (28 across)
[ebp+0x56] = 03afcc12          (row-pointer table base — the local that used to read 0)
```

##### What the array actually is — and why there is no width cap

Reading the three loops as index sets, rather than as byte ranges, changes the picture:

| pass | writes | reads |
|---|---|---|
| loop 1 `0x00453A40` | (even row, even col): rows `0..2*td+2`, cols `0..2*ta+2` | the map |
| loop 2 `0x00453B32` | (odd row, odd col): `(r+1, c+1)` for even `r, c` | the four loop-1 corners `(r|r+2, c|c+2)` |
| loop 3 `0x00453BC4` | — | (odd row, odd col): `(2i+1|2i+3, 2j+1|2j+3)` — note **`2j+3`**, since `-0x144E` is column +1 |

Half the cells — (even, odd) and (odd, even) — are never written or read. Now let a row spill past
byte 144: cell `(r, c)` with `c >= 36` lands on `(r+1, c-36)`, the same byte with the **opposite row
parity and the same column parity**, i.e. exactly one of the unused cells. A second wrap (`c >= 72`)
would land on `(r+2, c-72)` with matching parity and collide. So the 144-byte stride is correct for
`2*ta+2 < 72`, **34 tiles across**, and the only real limit is the room below the locals: the last
write is `(2*td+2, 2*ta+2)`, so the array needs

```
144*(2*td+2) + 4*(2*ta+2) + 4  bytes   <=   0x1452 + 0x2E = 5248
```

which is `5044` for 17×16 (fits), `5068` for 20×16 (fits — the §10.4 retraction of 640×512 was
unfounded), `5964` for 24×19 and `7148` for 28×23 (both over: the crashes). The same table as
§10.4's, one column further right.

##### What was patched — 13 sites, no stride change

The ×144 idiom is left alone. `patch_resolution.py` grows the frame whenever the footprint above
exceeds the stock room, by `delta = roundup16(footprint - 5248)`:

| site | stock | 28×23 (`delta = 0x770`) |
|---|---|---|
| `0x00453915` `sub esp,imm32` | `0x14CC` | `0x1C3C` |
| 10 × `[reg+ebp+disp32]` at `0x00453B20 B7A B81 B88 B91 BB3 C05 C2D C3C C5D` | `-0x1456/-0x1452/-0x144E/-0x144A` | each `- delta` |
| PE optional header `+0x48` SizeOfStackReserve | `0x13880` (80 000) | `0x100000` |
| PE optional header `+0x4C` SizeOfStackCommit | `0x10000` (64 KB) | `0x40000` |

Nothing else moves: `ebp` is set *before* the `sub esp` (`mov ebp,esp; sub esp,14CCh; sub ebp,7Ah`),
so every local `[ebp+0x2E…0x8E]` and the arguments stay put; the epilogue is `lea esp,[ebp+7Ah]`
at `0x00454303`, independent of the frame size; and no pointer to the array ever leaves the frame
(there is no `lea reg,[ebp-14xx]` in the function). The ten `disp32` fields are already 7-byte
instructions, so the edit is a value change only.

The header rows are there because **Watcom emits no stack probe**. A frame that grows by two pages
in one `sub esp` is only safe if that stack is already committed; the stock header commits 64 KB,
and touching past the guard page without touching the guard page is an access violation, not a
stack growth. Raising the commit (and the 80 000-byte reserve, which was tight for a 1 MB-era
default) costs nothing and removes the question. The checksum field is 0 in both builds, so the
header edit needs no fix-up.

Both builds take the patch at the same sites: ENGEXP16 is `+0x60` for all 11 code sites and the
header offsets are identical (`0xE0`/`0xE4`).

##### What this run does not show

Correct *lighting* at 28 across is argued from the index sets above, not observed — the run was a
crash test under `cdb`, and exclusive-mode DirectDraw gives no screenshot. The parity argument is
tight, but a look at the right-hand third of the view during a night phase would close it. Also
still only exercised on the attract-mode demo map (128×112 tiles).

#### 10.6 First look at the picture: the lightplane's hidden 512, and the `count` widgets **(verified)**

The first time a person looked at the 28×23-tile battlefield (9 Sep 2026, evening; stage 3 exe,
`hud_layout.py build` frame, `hud_layout.py maine apply` script) the report was: the whole screen
is used, nothing hangs, the unit-order icons are where they should be — but **the build buttons
are not visible at all**, and **the screen is full of repetitive black lines**. Both had one-line
causes, and both were found in the disassembly without another launch.

##### The black lines: `draw_terrain` fills the lightplane with a hardcoded 512-byte row stride

`draw_terrain` `0x00453910` does not draw terrain pixels at all. Its first half is the stack
lightmap of §10.4/10.5; its second half (`0x00453BC4…0x004542E0`, the per-tile loop) **fills the
lightplane** — the 1-byte-per-pixel buffer at `view+0x1C` that `lighting_init` allocates at the
viewport size — one 32×32 tile at a time. Per tile it copies 32 rows of 8 dwords from the fade
table `0x00533C90` (`rep movsd`, `ecx = 8`), and between one row and the next it does

```
00453CCB  05 00 02 00 00        add  eax,200h        ; next lightplane row = +512 bytes
...                                                  ; 30 of these
004542BC  8D B8 00 02 00 00     lea  edi,[eax+200h]  ; and the 32nd row
```

The advance from one **tile** to the next (`[ebp+0x52] = 0x20`, `0x004542D9`) and from one
**tile row** to the next (`imul eax,[0x0049931C]`, `0x004542E8`) both use the real width; only the
31 pixel-row steps inside a tile are the literal `0x200` = 512, i.e. the stock viewport width
written as a constant. With an 896-wide plane, rows 1…31 of every tile land at byte offsets
`k*512` instead of `k*896`: row `k` of the tile ends up on plane row `⌊k·4/7⌋` at a column offset
of `(k·512) mod 896`, so four out of every seven plane rows get a 32-byte slice of *some* tile's
light while the other three keep whatever the allocator left (zero; *inferred* that this reads as
the darkest level — the tester saw black). Every tile repeats the same pattern relative to its own
origin, hence a perfectly regular grid of unlit lines over the whole battlefield. The tile *pixels* underneath are correct:
they are drawn by `0x0045011C` (`tile.c`/`juicel.c`, see below), which takes its destination
stride from `view+0x10` and reads the light back through `0x004538C0` = `plane + y*[0x0049931C] +
x`, the right formula — it was only ever fed a plane filled at the wrong stride.

This is the §8.2 trap in a third form. Not a 640 and not a strength-reduced multiply, but a
*viewport* constant, 512, encoded as a plain `imm32`; a search for `280h`/`500h` cannot see it,
and the "sweep for `shl` after a ×5 idiom" cannot either. What found it was reading the function
that owns the buffer end to end after the symptom was known. A grep for `,200h` over
`AUTO 0x430000…0x46FFFF` afterwards shows the 31 sites and nothing else resolution-shaped: the
other hits are the `sprite->xsize < 512` asserts at `0x0043623E`ff (`engmain.c` line 236), a
`mov ebx,200h` buffer length at `0x00457A18`, and struct offsets.

**Fix:** `patch_resolution.py` stage 3 now rewrites all 31 to the viewport width
(`05 80 03 00 00` / `8D B8 80 03 00 00` for 896). Same length, no code motion; ENGEXP16 takes them
at `+0x60`, byte-verified in the stock file. Stage 3 is now 52 sites, plus the 11 lightmap-frame
sites and the 2 PE header fields when the frame is grown: **107 edits** in total for 1024×768
(was 76).

##### The tile drawer, for the record

The function that does put terrain pixels on screen is `0x0045011C` (between `juicel.c` and
`lighting.c` in link order, so `tile.c`/`mapit.c`). It takes the view struct in `eax` and:

* reads the tile counts back out of the viewport size (`[view+0x0A]>>16>>5`, `[view+0x0C]>>16>>5`),
  the destination stride from `[view+0x0E]>>16` (= the u16 at `+0x10`) and a **zoom shift** from
  the u16 at `+0x12` (`edx = 5 - zoom`, tile pixel size `32 >> zoom`);
* computes each tile's destination as `dest + ((row<<zoom)*stride + (col<<zoom))*2`
  (`0x004501F0…0x00450218`, into `0x00499314`), so it is resolution-independent;
* dispatches the actual 32×32 blit through two function tables indexed by zoom and by two tile
  flags: `0x0048C14C` (`call [edx+eax*4+0048C14Ch]`, `0x004503E1`) and `0x0048C15C`
  (`0x004502E7`) — another pair of `DGROUP → AUTO` pointer tables that no call graph shows;
* builds the **occlusion mask** (`view+0x18`, "kev: maskbuffer") as it goes: for each tile it
  writes `32 >> zoom` dwords, one per pixel row, each dword being the 32 pixels of that row of the
  tile passed through the bit table at `0x005326A4` (built by `0x004500B0`); the mask row stride
  is `tiles_across * 4` bytes (`0x00450384`, `0x004503AF`) and the tile-row advance
  `tiles_across * (32>>zoom) * 4` (`0x004503FA`). So the mask is `tiles_across*4 × tiles_down*32`
  bytes = `0x7000` at 16×14 and `0x14200` at 28×23 — the layout derives from the view struct and
  only the allocation size (`0x00435F88`) is literal, as stage 3 already assumed.

##### The build buttons: two widget kinds the HUD tool did not know

`MAINE` has **80 `count` widgets** — every building, troop and upgrade button in the build panel,
a `pushb` with a price counter — and one `scount`, the money counter. Neither kind was in
`hud_layout.py`'s `KINDS`, so `maine apply` moved the 75 generic panel widgets to x ≥ 900 and left
all 81 of these at x = 518 / 577 / 524, which at 1024×768 is the middle of the map view. The
widget layer paints them, the terrain paints over them next frame: "not visible at all". The unit
order buttons (`pushb`/`checkb`) had moved, which is why those looked right.

Also visible in the same test data: §6.1 above previously counted "82 widgets" for the same
reason. Corrected there. `hud_layout.py maine` now shifts 156 panel widgets right.

**Second visual test (same evening): both fixed** — no lines, build panel present.

##### Where the panel's extra 288 rows go

The maintainer's next note was that the Build button, its status box and the money counter must
sit on the bottom edge of the screen as in the original. The first `build` had spliced the
panel's new rows in at y = 450, *below* the Build button, which left the button mid-screen with
blank rail under it. Measuring the panel column (`x 516…639`) row by row settles where the seam
belongs: rows `94…398` carry only the 6-px side rail (the button grid is drawn entirely by the
`count` widgets), and row **399** is the first full-width bar of the bottom cluster — status box
`399…415`, BUILD `416…432`, DAYS `433…444`, money dial `445…472`, bottom frame `473…479`. So the
splice is at **399**: minimap, tabs and grid stay at the top, everything from 399 down moves by
288 to `687…767`, and the four widgets on it move with it — `in_text #79` (520,404) → (904,692),
`pushb #19` BUILD (516,422) → (900,710), `in_text #234` DAYS (613,433) → (997,721), `scount #75`
(524,456) → (908,744). `hud_layout.py` has `PANEL_INSERT = 399` for the script side and
`insert=399` on the `right_panel` region for the art side; they must agree. `plan` output now:
156 × `x += 384`, 10 × `y += 288` (4 bottom-bar widgets, 2 message lines, the 4-widget cluster),
1 left alone (`picture #199`).

**Third visual test:** the bottom cluster is in place. Remaining complaint: the bottom bar's
message box had "an ugly break in the middle".

##### The bottom bar: splice inside the message box, and repeat a stretch, not a line

The first `build` spliced the bar's 384 new columns in at x = 520 — *after* the message box's
right frame (`509…515`) and into the panel corner — and filled them with the single most common
column, so the box was cut in two with a bar down the middle. Measured column by column, the bar
is: arrow buttons `4…44`, the message box frame `46…52`, the **box interior `53…508` with only four
distinct columns** — black between two bevel lines whose rows 457/461/474/478 alternate at random
between two greys (`44/40`, `60/62`) — the right frame `509…515`, then the panel. The §5.1 note
"no period beyond ~49 px, needs real artwork" was measuring that random dither and drawing the
wrong conclusion: there is no period because it is noise, and noise repeats invisibly.

So `build` now splices the bar at **x = 300**, inside the interior, and fills — for every
region — by repeating the **128 lines just before the splice** rather than one line. The top and
left borders are the same case (two lines in random alternation), the panel and the map edge are
constant over their splice, so the 128-line filler is exact everywhere and the whole frame extends
without new artwork. The one bottom-bar widget right of the splice, `in_text #200` at (480,463),
the 3-character field at the box's right end, moves with the box's end: → (864,751)
(`BOTTOM_INSERT = 300` in `hud_layout.py`). `plan`: 156 × `x += 384` in the panel plus that one,
10 × `y += 288`, 1 left alone.

**Still unverified:** the lighting at the right-hand edge during a night phase (§10.5's open
question), and the new bottom bar in the game.

#### 10.7 The menu furniture that code draws: two primitives, 44 immediates, and two data omissions **(verified)**

After the battlefield was right, a full pass through the menus at 1024×768 produced the list
§10.1 had warned about: the campaign overview text, the mission-briefing globe and description,
the network screen's globe, the encyclopedia's text and turning models, the victory screen's
debrief text and medal — all still at 640×480 coordinates while the letterboxed scripts around
them had moved by (+192,+144). Plus two captions on the main menu ("Choose race", "Type in a name
for your leader") and the "Rank" caption on the briefing screen.

##### Everything code-positioned goes through two `scenario.c` primitives

Reading the seven screen functions in `main.c` (they are the ones containing the
`load_interface` calls listed in §6) shows that they draw nothing themselves. Every
code-positioned element is created by one of two calls, both taking **x in `edx` and y in `ebx`**
as `mov reg, imm32` at the call site and storing them once:

| Primitive | Args | Stores | Drawn by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x00428448` **text-file box** ("TTY", asserts "Too many TTYs" `0x48501C`) | `(app, x, y, w; [esp] h, filename, font, …)`, `ret 20h` | slot record, stride `0x3EE8`: x `0x4D61C8`, y `0x4D61CC`, w `0x4D61D0`, h `0x4D61D4` (`0x004284F0…0x00428517`) | `0x00428968`: glyph at `x + col·cellw + col`, `y + row·cellh + row`, `call [ctx+5Ch]` |
| `0x004289D0` **animated picture window** ("PIC", asserts "Too many PIC Windows" `0x485078`) | `(app, x, y, spritename; [esp] period, …, erase_bg)`, `ret 1Ch` | slot record, stride `0x60`: x `0x4DE008`, y `0x4DE00C` (`0x00428A65/74`) | `0x00428B8C`: erase rect `call [ctx+60h]`, cell blit `call [ctx+58h]` with `edx=x, ebx=y` |

So the whole fix is the 44 immediates at the call sites, all `imm32` (no `imm8` overflow
anywhere), all `+192` / `+144`. Widths and heights stay. The `push 32h/21h/42h/2Dh` next to the
PIC calls are frame periods, not coordinates. `patch_resolution.py` carries them as
`MENU_FURNITURE` in **stage 2**, since they belong with the letterboxing they compensate for:

| Screen (function) | Element | Sites | Stock (x, y) |
|---|---|---|---|
| campaign overview `story` (`0x004023F4`) | `hstory.txt`/`astory.txt` TTY 579×420 | `0x0040247B` / `0x00402471` | (10, 13) |
| encyclopedia `encyclo` (`0x00402614`) | unit text TTY 238×356, six code paths | `0x00402707 …0x00402E40` (x), `0x00402702 … 0x00402E4A` (y) | (20, 106) |
| | unit model PIC, six code paths | `0x0040272F … 0x00402E8B` (x), `0x00402728 … 0x00402E84` (y) | (303, 13) |
| mission briefing `shuman` (`0x00402F90`) | description TTY 294×225 | `0x0040320A` / `0x00403200` | (310, 212) |
| | globe PICs `globeg`+`globes` (human) / `earthg`+`earths` (alien), three call sites sharing a tail | `0x0040323F/7C/9F` (x), `0x00403249/75/9A` (y) | (34, 26) |
| network `netopt` (`0x00405C40`) | globe PIC `intrface/blew` | `0x00405C71` / `0x00405C60` | (336, 24) |
| victory `wingame` | debrief TTY 445×112 (`"%s.%3.3d"`) | `0x00404281` / `0x0040427A` | (29, 190) |
| | medal PIC `intrface/mdl%c`, created and re-created on click | `0x00404474/0x004047F3` (x), `0x0040446D/0x004047EC` (y) | (541, 169) |
| intro `bintro` (`0x00404DC8`) | scrolling `credits.txt` TTY 280×100 | `0x00404EA0` / `0x00404E99` | (178, 200) | — since §10.11 not +192/+144 but the full-frame menu's cluster position (fixups) |

§10.1's guess that the network screen shows `globeg/globes` was wrong: that pair (and
`earthg/earths`) is the *briefing* globe; the network screen's is `blew`. The main menu draws
nothing by code, and there is no separate "name your leader" screen: that prompt is `in_text 5`
plus `label 18` on `NEWGAMEE`. `meta`, `multi`, `lost`, `loadg`, `dpblank`, `dplays`, `getsvr`,
`ipxname` and the `interface.c` dialogs call neither primitive.

##### Two things that were data after all

1. **`label` was missing from `pad_background.py`'s widget-kind list.** The keyword table at
   `0x004895F0` pairs `"label"` with handler `0x00424A40`, which parses `x y w h` through the
   same field parser (`0x00422414`) as every other kind. So the 44 `label` lines across the
   scripts — including the four the tester saw — had never moved. `POSITIONED` now has `label`
   (and, for completeness, `count`/`scount`). A census of every keyword in the 30 scripts found
   no other positioned kind: `banim` carries frame indices, `animation` and `text` file names.
2. **The mission marker on the briefing globe is placed by `GAMESTAT/*SCENE.TXT`.** `main.c`
   `0x00403732` creates `intrface/epic` at `(gs+0x14E0, gs+0x14DC)` when the globe reaches frame
   `gs+0x14D4`; `scenario.c 0x00429B67`ff fills those three with `sscanf("%d %d %d")` from the
   `frame x y` line of each mission block (the line after the two `.avi` lines, e.g. `25 110 30`).
   `pad_background.py apply` now adds (192,144) to the second and third numbers in `HSCENE.TXT`,
   `GSCENE.TXT` (15 blocks each), `HTSCENE.TXT`, `GTSCENE.TXT` (7 each), with `.bak`s, and
   `revert` restores them. Which of the two numbers is x is *inferred* from the two `mov` at
   `0x00403726/2C`; a wrong guess would show as a marker off the globe.

`pad_background.py` also re-derives from `.bak` on a re-run now, so adding a kind and running
`apply` again is enough (previously a padded script was mistaken for a sub-window dialog and
skipped).

**ENGEXP16 note.** The two `netopt` sites sit at `−0x20`, not `+0x60`, and the credits' stock y
differs (`0xE6` = 230, not 200): `main.c` is not a uniform shift there. The expected-byte check
caught it; §10.10 re-derived those three and the patcher carries them as build fixups.

#### 10.8 Movies: the frame path, and why stretching needed a re-route **(verified in code; game test pending)**

Same test pass: at 1024×768 the FMVs played letterboxed in the top-left instead of stretched
across the screen, and with periodic black lines. All 59 `AVI/*.avi` are **320×180 Cinepak**
(`strf`), so the source is 16:9, not 320×240.

##### How a frame reaches the screen (`avi.c`)

```
main.c 0x00401137  avi_begin 0x00406FD0 → avi_create_surfaces 0x00407068
main.c 0x00401149  [vtbl+3Ch] → 0x004073B8 → play_avi 0x00408CB8
main.c 0x0040114E  avi_end   0x00406FF0 → clear_and_flip 0x00407440, release_surfaces 0x00407018, mode cycle

play_avi: open_video 0x0040818C (AVIStream + ICLocate, BITMAPINFO forced to 24 bpp at 0x004083DA),
          open_audio 0x00407E60, build_luts 0x0040755C (R/G/B 8→16 LUTs 0x4A49C0/4DC0/51C0, then the
          geometry below), four threads (0x00408784 audio feed, 0x00408BB0 decode, 0x00408AC8 display,
          0x00408558 sync)
display thread 0x00408AC8: cmp [0x488E0C],1 ; jne → draw_offscreen 0x00407898
                                            ;  else  draw_flip      0x00407674
```

`avi_create_surfaces` makes a primary + one back buffer (`DDSCAPS 0x4218`, `0x489718`/`0x48971C`,
flag **`0x488E0C = 1`**, "flip mode"). Only if that fails does it fall back to a plain primary
and create the **320×180 offscreen movie surface `0x488E00`** (`0x004071F7…`, `dwWidth` at
`0x0040722B`, `dwHeight` at `0x00407230`, flag = 0).

**Flip mode, `draw_flip 0x00407674`, is a software 2× doubler into the back buffer.** It Locks
the back buffer and *does* take `lPitch` from the description (`0x004076C9`), converts each 24-bpp
source pixel through the LUTs into a DWORD holding two identical 16-bit pixels
(`mov [edx+ebx*4-4],edi`, `0x00407760` — the horizontal 2×), then per source row advances the
destination by **two** rows (`0x0040776F/0x00407775`) having written **one**. So the stock game
paints 640 × 2(H−1) = 640×358 at `(0, yoff)` with **every odd row untouched** — the "periodic
black lines" are the design of the stock doubler, filled black by the clear at 640×480 and
presumably invisible on a CRT. `yoff = 241 − H` (`0x0040762B`, `mov edx,0F0h; sub edx,H−1`)
centres the doubled picture in 480 rows: rows 61…418, 61-px bars. The letterbox is the stock
proportion.

Two things break at 1024×768: the doubler is fixed 2× anchored at x = 0 (no x term anywhere in
`0x004076F0…0x00407703`), so it fills 640×358 of the 1024×768 back buffer; and the clear
`0x004073C4` Locks the back buffer but then **ignores the description** — 640 pixels per row, a
1280-byte pitch and 480 rows are literals (`0x004073F4/05/0B`) — so with a 2048-byte pitch it
clears exactly the top 300 rows and leaves the rest as stale VRAM, which is what shows through the
skipped rows below row 300.

**Fallback mode, `draw_offscreen 0x00407898`,** writes the frame **1:1** into the 320×180 surface
(pitch from its own Lock, `0x004078ED`), then `BltFast`s it to the primary at `(160, 2·yoff)`
(`0x00407E14…0x00407E4F`). `BltFast` cannot stretch, so nobody ever saw this path at its best.

##### The fix: use the fallback surface in flip mode and stretch with `Blt`

A same-length edit cannot make the doubler fill 1024×768 (3.2× is not integer, 3× needs three
stores and three row writes — a loop rewrite). The 1:1 path plus a **stretching
`IDirectDrawSurface::Blt`** does everything at once — full width, every row written, dest rect a
tunable immediate — and every edit is in place. Stage 4 of `patch_resolution.py`:

| Site | Stock | New | Effect |
|---|---|---|---|
| `0x004073F4` / `05` / `0B` | `cmp eax,280h` / `add ecx,500h` / `cmp edx,1E0h` | `cmp eax,[ebp-60h]` / `add ecx,[ebp-5Ch]` / `cmp edx,[ebp-64h]` (+ nops) | clear reads dwWidth / lPitch / dwHeight from its own Lock description (`DDSURFACEDESC` at `[ebp-6Ch]`: +8 height, +0xC width, +0x10 pitch, +0x24 `lpSurface` — the last was already read) |
| `0x0040712E` (13 B) | `test eax,eax; je 40728B; jmp 4073AC` | `mov edx,eax; jmp 4071E0; nop×6` | after `GetAttachedSurface`: on success `edx=0` → `0x4071E0` `test edx,edx; je 4071F7` → create the 320×180 surface (the `memset(desc, edx, 6Ch)` at `0x00407204` takes its fill byte from `edx`, hence the `mov`); on failure (`eax≠0`) the same path returns 0 via `0x4071E4` |
| `0x0040723D` | `mov [488E0C],ebx` (=0) | nops | keep the flip flag when the movie surface is created in flip mode |
| `0x00408B3E` | `jne 408B47` | `jmp` | display thread always takes `draw_offscreen` |
| `0x00407E14` (62 B) | `BltFast(primary, 160, 2·yoff, movie, &(0,0,320,180), WAIT)` | `Blt(primary, &(0,96,1024,672), movie, NULL, DDBLT_WAIT, NULL)` | the stretch. Dest rect built in `[ebp+62h…71h]` (loop temporaries, dead after the copy); 16:9 across the full width, centred — the stock proportion |
| `0x00407479` | `jmp 407552` | nops | `clear_and_flip` falls through into the movie-surface clear (null-checked) in flip mode too |
| `0x00407030` | `jne 40704A` | nops | `release_surfaces` releases the movie surface whenever it exists (else one surface leaks per movie) |
| `0x0040791B` | `jae` | `ja` | `draw_offscreen` writes all H rows; stock wrote H−1 and left the bottom row stale (an off-by-one the doubler shares) |

The first draft of the `0x0040712E` rewrite used `je 4071F7; jmp rel8 4071EC` — the `jmp rel8`
is 178 bytes forward and does not fit a signed byte (it would have landed at `0x4070EC`); the
`mov edx,eax; jmp rel32 4071E0` form above avoids a second jump entirely. The Blt block carries
three absolute data addresses (`0x489718`, `0x488E00`, `0x4A5680`), so `patch_resolution.py` builds
both its expected and its replacement bytes from the build's DGROUP and `.bss` shifts; ENGEXP16
shifts `0x488Exx`/`0x4897xx` by `+0x28` and the `.bss` address not at all (§10.10), and the block
matched byte for byte at `0x7274` once the table said so.

**Risks.** The movie surface is requested as `VIDEOMEMORY` (`0x4040`, from `[ebp-4]=1` in flip
mode); if all 10 attempts fail, `avi_create_surfaces` returns 0 and `main.c` skips the movie
silently — the fallback edit is `0x0040721B` `C7 45 F4 40 40 00 00` → `… 40 08 …`
(`SYSTEMMEMORY`). `Blt` to the primary without `Flip` can tear (the stock fallback did the same;
blitting to the back buffer and flipping needs 15 bytes more than the block has). Dest-rect
alternatives are the four immediates in the block: `(0,0,1024,768)` full screen (distorts
16:9→4:3), or 3× integer `(32,114,992,654)`.

#### 10.9 The minimap's input side **(verified)**

Fifth test pass: clicking the minimap to send troops did nothing. Stage 3 had moved the
minimap's *rendering* (the two framebuffer origins and strides, §8.1) but not the three other
places that know where it is, all of them the plain immediate **519** (`0x207`):

| VA | Code | Role |
|---|---|---|
| `0x0041EE43` | `proto.c`: `make_rect(519, 6, 96, 84)` → `ui+0x7B4` (`0x004AB184`) at mission start | the **hit rectangle**. The click dispatcher `0x0040A484`ff tests the map view rect first (`[ui+8]`), then this one (`point_in_rect 0x0043658C` on `ui+0x7B4…0x7C0`, `0x0040A517`) before calling the minimap handler `0x0040A070` |
| `0x0040A084` | minimap handler: `sub eax,207h` | mouse x → minimap column: `tile_x = ((x−519)·2+1)·map_w / 96 / 2`; the y side is `90 − y` (`0x0040A0B5`, the minimap's bottom edge, unchanged) |
| `0x0043A1E4` | `engmain.c` minimap plot: `make_rect(519, 6, 96, 84)` | the clip rect for the plot |
| `0x0043A27A` | `add eax,207h` | the **view-box indicator**: `view_x·96/map_w + 519` (y side `+6` at `0x0043A25F`) |

All four → the new minimap x (903), stage 3 of `patch_resolution.py`. ENGEXP16 has them at
`+0x60`. The other `0x207`/`0x208` hits in the binary are assert line numbers and buffer sizes.
So the minimap's x is written **seven** times in three ways — two framebuffer byte offsets
`(6·640+519)·2`, one rect built at init and reused, four bare immediates — and the y (6) twice
as a rect argument, once as its bottom edge 90, and inside the two byte offsets.

#### 10.10 Stage 6: the same patch on Council Wars `ENGEXP16.EXE` **(verified; confirmed in game)**

With the Classic build confirmed in five test passes, the whole patch was carried over to the
expansion's executable. Running the patcher against stock `ENGEXP16.EXE` refused to write on
exactly **five** of the 165 edits, all three of them kinds of deviation that the `+0x60`/`+0x228`
rule of §8 does not describe:

| Site(s) | Rule said | Found | Cause |
|---|---|---|---|
| `netopt` globe PIC x, y (`0x00405C71/60` Classic) | `+0x60` → `0x50D1/0x50C0` | at **`0x5051/0x5040`** (`−0x20`); the stock values 336/24 unchanged | `main.c` is `0x20` bytes shorter from just after the intro screens up to `avi.c` — the same stretch that put the CD-button patch at `0x507F` instead of `0x509F` (CLAUDE.md) |
| `bintro` credits TTY y (`0x00404E99`) | `bb c8 00 00 00` (200) at `+0` | `bb e6 00 00 00` (**230**) at `+0`; the x (178) matches | a different stock layout for the expansion's own `exp/intrface/credits.txt`; the target is still stock + 144 |
| flip-flag store `mov [0x488E0C],ebx` (`0x0663D`) | `+0x228` in DGROUP | `mov [0x488E34],ebx` (**`+0x28`**) | see below |
| the 62-byte `BltFast` block (`0x07214`) | `0x489718`, `0x488E00`, `0x4A5680` `+0x228` | `0x489740`, `0x488E28` (**`+0x28`**), `0x4A5680` (**`+0`**) | see below |

**Why `+0x228` and `+0x28` are both right.** ENGEXP16's `AUTO` section has a raw size of
`0x7E400` against Classic's `0x7E200`, so the *file pointer* of every later section (`.idata`,
`DGROUP`, `.reloc`, `.rsrc`) is `+0x200`, while the sections' *virtual addresses* are identical
(`DGROUP` at `0x482000`, `.bss` at `0x49A000` in both). Inside `DGROUP` the data the patched code
names has moved by `+0x28` (the dimension anchor: VA `0x488DB4` → `0x488DDC`, i.e. file `0x865B4`
→ `0x867DC` = `+0x200 +0x28`; the movie surface, its flag and the primary likewise). The `.bss`
variables the patch names — `yoff 0x4A5680` and the DirectInput mouse position `0x5327C0/C4` —
sit at the same VA in both builds. So a site's *file offset* moves by the AUTO rule, a DGROUP
*address in its bytes* by `+0x28`, and a `.bss` address by `+0`; the earlier `+0x228` was the
anchor's file shift misread as a VA shift.

**The code-section delta map.** Matching 32-byte windows of Classic at every `0x40` step against
ENGEXP16 (±`0x200`) gives, ignoring one-window blips at jump tables: `+0` from `0x400` to about
`0x4500`; `−0x20` from about `0x4800` to `0x5880` (`main.c`'s network screen and everything up to
`avi.c`); `+0x60` from `0x5880` (VA `0x406480`) to the end. The patcher's threshold of `0x5000`
therefore mis-derives only sites in `0x4800…0x5880`, of which the site table has exactly the two
`netopt` ones. The 23 `TTY`/`PIC` call sites of §10.7 are one-to-one between the builds with the
same 44 immediates except the two moved and the one changed above, so the expansion adds no
code-positioned menu furniture of its own.

**What the patcher does now.** `BUILDS` is a table per build of `(AUTO shift, DGROUP VA shift,
.bss VA shift, fixups)`; a fixup overrides a site's file offset, its expected bytes and/or its
value function, and everything else still goes through the same expected-byte check. The two
sites that name a `.bss` address (`DirectInput clamp: X/Y maximum`) and the flip-flag store now
build their expected bytes from the shifts too, so the table has no hidden absolute address left.
Result: `plan` prints **165 edits** for both builds with no mismatch; the 24 bytes of code before
every ENGEXP16 site differ from Classic in at most four bytes (relocated operands), so each match
is the same instruction in the same function, not a coincidence. `verify` after `apply` reports
18/66/67/10 patched per stage and the two PE stack fields patched, i.e. the same tallies as
Classic.

**What `exp/` is.** `ENGEXP16` opens every data file through a wrapper (`0x004063E4`, string
`"exp/"` at `0x4826D0`) that first tries `exp/<path>` and, if that open fails, `<path>`. So the
expansion overrides individual files without touching the base install: `exp/intrface/bintroe`,
`introe`, `shumane` (the intro screens with the campaign buttons rearranged into one column at
x = 228, and the briefing screen with one button commented out) — their `background` GIFs are the
base `INTRFACE/INTRG.GIF`, `INTRO.GIF`, `SHUMAN.GIF` — and `exp/gamestat/hxscene.txt`,
`gxscene.txt` (the Aerogen and Council campaigns, eight mission blocks each, with the same
`frame x y` globe-marker line as §10.7). `pad_background.py` therefore learnt to look for a
script's GIF in the game root's `INTRFACE` when the script lives in `exp/intrface`, and to treat
`HXSCENE`/`GXSCENE` as scene files; the Council Wars data build is two runs, `INTRFACE` first
and `exp/intrface` second.

**Test build** `C:\Users\nika\Documents\Dark-Colony-CW-1024` (a copy of `DC - Council wars`):
`patch_resolution.py apply` (165 edits, `.bak` kept), `pad_background.py apply` on `INTRFACE`
(29 scripts, 18 GIFs, both loading bitmaps, four scene files) and on `exp/intrface` (3 scripts,
2 scene files), `hud_layout.py build` + `maine apply`. Because the expansion ships the Classic
`INTRFACE.GIF`, `MAINE`, `MAINBUT.SPR`, menu scripts and scene files unchanged, all 54 base data
outputs are **byte-identical** to the confirmed Classic test build; only the three `exp/` scripts
and the two `exp/` scene files are new. **The maintainer played the build on 9 Sep 2026 and
reported everything working.**

##### Release: the repository binaries are patched

With both test builds confirmed, the same three tools were run on the repository copies
(`DC - Classic` and `DC - Council wars`) on 9 Sep 2026, and every changed file was checked
byte for byte against the corresponding test build before committing: 165 exe edits per binary,
the letterboxed menus, loading screens and scene files, the rebuilt `INTRFACE.GIF` and `MAINE`,
and for Council Wars the `exp/` overrides. The `.bak` files the tools leave beside the originals
are gitignored; the stock executables and data are the versions before that commit (last stock
state: `0307feb`), and `patch_resolution.py verify` distinguishes a patched binary from a stock
one by reading the dimension globals back. Because `pad_background.py` and `hud_layout.py maine`
recognise an already-transformed script (a four-argument `size` line), re-running the tools on
the repository is a no-op rather than a double shift.

Still open under stage 6: Council Wars `dc16.exe` (a different build: only the §3 anchor
transfers, so the whole site table would have to be re-derived in Ghidra), and the map editor.

#### 10.11 The main menu repainted full-frame: a procedural backdrop and re-baked logos **(verified by measurement; game test pending)**

The first screen after the intro movie (NEW CAMPAIGN, TRAINING, LOAD GAME, …) was the most
visible letterboxed screen: a 640×480 picture with black borders in a 1024×768 frame. On
10 Sep 2026 it became the first screen painted at the new size (Route B of §10.1). Four things
about it were data that had to be measured before anything could be drawn — and one of them was
learned from a failed game test.

**Which script is the menu.** The retail exe names only `intrface/bintro` (`main.c` `bintro`
`0x00404DC8`, the function that also creates the scrolling credits box of §10.7), so the live menu
is **`bintroe`** with background **`INTRFACE/INTRG.GIF`**, the `DCUK` logo animation and the `DCUT`
title. `introe` (background `INTRO.GIF`, `DCSS` logo) is the same menu in an older dress and is
not reached; `BUTTONSE` and `DINTROE` are demo leftovers on `INTRO.GIF`. The first pass of this
work repainted `INTRO.GIF` and `introe` only, and the maintainer saw no change in either game —
that test is what pinned the screen down. Council Wars adds `exp/intrface/BINTROE` / `INTROE`
overrides (one column of buttons, the same sprites at the same places). `INTRG.GIF` and
`INTRO.GIF` are the same picture except for the bottom band (Take 2 logo and copyright in the one,
SSI logo, red rule and copyright in the other); both now exist full-frame and all six scripts say
`size 1024 768`.

**The palette.** Both GIFs' colour table is **the game's master palette, byte-identical to
`PALETTE.GIF`** (`CHOO`, `LOADER`, `LOST`, `STORY`, `NET` have their own). `INTRO.RGB` (32 768 B,
the 15-bit inverse lookup) and `INTRO.RMP` (196 608 B) are derived from that table, so the repaint
keeps all 256 entries as they are and only produces new indices — the constraint §5.1 states for
the HUD frame. The sprites' embedded palettes differ from it in one or two entries and are not
what the game draws with (viewing `DCUK` through its own table gives a green sky); always decode
sprites through the screen palette.

**Geometry of the stock picture, measured on the indices.** Fitting circles to the limb
(outermost limb-coloured pixel per row, both sides, plus the top edge) gives the planet as a disc
centred at **(320, 351) with radius 291** in the 640×480 frame (left edge alone fits with σ =
0.95 px), i.e. centre (0.500 W, 0.731 H), radius 0.607 H. Outside the limb a **10 px glow**
(luminance 7 → 50 over rows 48…60 at the centre column). Inside, a **lit crescent 45 px deep at
the top**, whose brightness along the centre column falls as (1 − d/45)^1.3 (luminance 115, 95,
57, 33, 9 at d = 0, 10, 20, 30, 40) and whose depth and peak fall with the angle θ from the top
as ≈ 45·cos^2.2 θ and ≈ cos^1.6 θ — 30 px deep at 30°, 22 at 45°, 10 at 60°, nothing beyond
±75°. The peak colour is index 204 (239, 95, 0); the whole crescent lives on the orange ramp
201…251, and it already carries faint darker streaks (surface texture). The sky holds **1 244
stars over 251 198 px** (4.95 × 10⁻³ per pixel): 55 % single pixels, 67 % with a peak below 40
(indices 67/66/62), 6.5 % saturated white, mostly neutral with a few blue (107), violet (119) and
pink (144…159) pixels — the violet/blue ones are the halos of the bright stars. Everything below
row 421 is the band: in `INTRO.GIF` the SSI logo (rows 423…447, x 274…359), a full-width rule
(rows 448…458, one solid colour per row: indices 56, 4, 1, 97, 84 ×4, 194, 1, 44) and the
copyright line (rows 462…475, x 48…587); in `INTRG.GIF` the Take 2 logo and copyright (rows
435…478, x 97…516), no rule.

**The picture is not resampled; it is re-rendered from those numbers** (`tools/paint_intro.py`).
Stars and planet are procedural — the master is the generator and its measured parameters, so
any resolution is a re-render, which is the point of the vector-first rule of §5.1 for art that
has no vector form. Stars keep their pixel size (a point of light does not grow with the canvas)
and their density per pixel, with the stock brightness distribution (2/3 faint, ~5 % saturated),
the nearest pixel always carrying the full brightness so single-pixel stars stay crisp, and the
bright ones get the stock's cold blue-violet halo and a faint cross. The planet keeps its
proportions (centre and radius scale with the height), the measured crescent profile, and gains
what "more robust" was asked for: two scales of noise in a longitude/latitude parametrisation of
the sphere (so features foreshorten towards the limb), 0.55…1.35 albedo, dark terrain leaning
browner; the thin atmospheric rim at the edge is not modulated by terrain. The render is
quantised to the nearest colour of the fixed palette, with ±2 random dither only inside the disc
to break the ramp's 4-step banding; index 0 is never used (black is 254 as in the stock files).
The bands are UI-scale pixel art like the buttons and are **copied 1:1** (a row that is non-black
across the stock width is a rule and is extended to the full width; the band keeps its distance
from the bottom edge and is centred). Statistics of the result: 259 star pixels per 10 k px
against the stock's 324 at 640×480; 121 distinct indices against 135.

**The logos have the stock backdrop baked into every frame — and live in `SPRITES/`.**
`gadget 14 … DCUK anim_stopped unmask - bg erase` names an *animation*, not a sprite file: the
screen's `INTRG.DAT` lists `knobe.fin`, `dcuk.fin`, `dcut.fin`, and `ANIMATE/DCUK.FIN` (2 276 B;
header `1D 00 0C 00 01 00 02 00`, bank names `dcuk`/`dcut`, animation name `DCUK`, then 18-byte
frame records `bank[8] cell:u16 flags:u16 duration:u32 …` for cells 2…13) is loaded through
`"animate/%s"` (`animate.c` `0x00425613`) and opens its sprite banks through **`"sprites/%s"`**
(`0x00425356`). So the frames the game draws come from **`SPRITES/DCUK.SPR`**, a **14-cell 310×120
assembly animation** (cell 0 a solid flash, index 133); `INTRFACE/DCUK.SPR` is a byte-identical
copy that nothing on this screen reads — the third game test, which still showed the stock stars
after only the `INTRFACE` copy had been re-baked, is what proved it. (`SPRITES/DCSS.SPR`, 29 cells,
is a longer cut of the `introe` logo than the 15-cell `INTRFACE` copy.) Each cell contains sky,
stars and the top of the limb — the gadgets are `unmask` (keyword table `0x004849A8`, handler
`0x00424BCB`), so the sprite carries its own background. `paint_intro.py apply` re-bakes every
copy it finds in `INTRFACE/` and `SPRITES/`. Black in the
sprites is index 0 (index 254 never occurs). That backdrop is *not* a byte copy of the GIF (only
20 % of the arc pixels agree; it is another quantisation of the same scene using browns 184…186
and red 101 the GIF does not), and the letters shimmer (consecutive frames are only 50–60 %
identical; `DCSS`'s last five frames agree on just 24 pixels), so neither "equals the GIF" nor
"static across frames" identifies it alone. With the planet 1.6× larger the baked arc showed as
a second, smaller limb through the letters. `paint_intro.py apply` therefore **re-bakes** the
cells (first against the new render, since the second game test with plain black — see Layout
below): a pixel is backdrop if it agrees with the per-pixel mode over the frames where that mode
has ≥ 5 supporters, or has a limb colour (r > g+8, r > b+8, g ≤ 0.6 r — 87 indices; the letters
above the limb contain 0.5 % such pixels), or is a non-limb speck of ≤ 12 connected pixels (a
star), or is black sky more than 1 px from a letter (the letters' black shadows stay 0). Those
pixels take the new render at the logo's new position; the letters, their shadows and the flying
pieces are untouched. **Fourth game test:** most stars gone, but light pixels still flickered on
the logo animation. Measured on the re-baked frames: a 179-px streak of the limb's darkest glow
colour, index 252 (7,0,0), which the colour family `r > g+8` had missed, with white and grey star
pixels glued into it (frames 1…3), plus stars touching a flying piece and therefore merged into
its component. Since the backdrop is now plain black anyway, the `black` mode is stricter than
`full`: the colour family is `g, b ≤ 0.65 r` (87 → includes 252 and 251), a pixel equal to the
*reference frame* (the frame with the least logo in it — the static baked backdrop, minus its own
pieces) is backdrop, and afterwards **everything that is not part of a piece of ≥ 100 connected
pixels is dropped**; a fragment between 12 and 100 px survives only if at least half its pixels
have logo colours (colours present in the big pieces but absent from the reference backdrop),
which keeps the tan sparks of frame 9 (three 13–14 px fragments) and removes star halos. Result:
0…4 surviving stock-backdrop pixels per frame, all dark (`DCUK`: up to 35 502 of 37 200 pixels per
cell replaced, 1 in the flash frame; `DCSS`: 22 311…45 563). `DCUT.SPR` (the 398×33 title, 5 cells: a solid flash, a
dark-red fade-in, a **red-white glow** frame, and the tan text) sits over the black disc and has
only 88 baked star pixels; its glow frame is all limb colours, so it gets the minimal rule —
only pixels equal to a non-black stock pixel underneath are replaced. `spr.py check` passes on all
three.

**The title re-set, the mark kept (fifth to eighth game tests).** With the menu accepted, the
maintainer asked for the DC mark and the "DARK COLONY" title themselves to be redone: clear,
robust and appealing shape, colour and surface — the stock sprites are 1997 pixel art with a
dithered fill and staircase edges. `tools/logo_art.py` re-sets the **title** from a typeface,
Impact stretched to the 398×33 cell (the stock's face is an extended stencil; no stencil font
exists on the machine, and a traced 33 px stencil came out lumpy): 8× supersampling, an erosion
distance field for a 2 px bevel lit from the top left with a specular highlight, a tan gradient
(232,170,112) → (172,112,60), horizontal brushed streaks and fine grain for the surface, a dark
1 px rim so the letters read on black, and nearest-colour quantisation with ±3 dither into the
palette indices with r ≥ g ≥ b (tans, browns, greys — no blue/green speckle); black is index 0;
five 398×33 cells — flash, dark-red fade-in, red-white glow, final with a hot highlight, final;
`DCUT.FIN` unchanged. **Approved in the sixth test.** For the **DC mark** two re-renders were
tried and both rejected: first a parametric vector redesign (a stencil-cut D, a C from two
ellipses with the slit and V-notches, a new seven-band sliding assembly) — "differs from the
original too much"; then the stock frames themselves as masters, backdrop removed, silhouettes
smoothed 0.8 px and re-lit with the same bevel, the frame colour following the stock's
grey-steel-to-tan progression — closer, but after a frame-9 extraction bug (its reddish-brown
pieces are limb-coloured and the colour rule ate a third of them) was fixed, still "not good".
The maintainer's decision (eighth test): **leave the DC logo alone** — `DCUK.SPR` is the original
1997 pixel art, re-baked onto black by `paint_intro.py` (mode `black`, the version approved in
the fifth test), and `logo_art.py` touches the title only. Lesson recorded for future art work:
the original shapes and animations are to be kept; only surface quality may change, and even
that is judged frame by frame in the game. Both `SPRITES/` and `INTRFACE/` copies of `DCUT.SPR`
are written; `paint_intro.py` marks that bank `art` and leaves it alone. `spr.py check` passes.

**Layout — second game test.** The maintainer's second test (background right) asked for two
things: the DC logo on **black**, and **right above the "DARK COLONY" title as in the original**,
not pinned to the top edge over the limb. So the title, credits and buttons form one cluster that
keeps its stock vertical centre as a fraction of the height and is centred horizontally (the
button grid as a unit, the title on its own), and the logo moves by the same amount, centred, so
the stock 39 px gap logo→title is preserved. The logo is an opaque 310×120 rectangle: its
backdrop is now plain black (rebake mode `black`, same pixel classification, index 0 instead of
the render), and because the proportional shift alone (+173) would have put its top rows over
the last (27,7,0) pixels of the crescent's tail (rows 173…190), every screen with a logo shifts
**20 px further** (`LOGO_CLEARANCE`), onto rows that are entirely black under the rectangle
(measured: 0 non-black pixels under (357…667, 193…313)). In `bintroe` the cluster is rows
159…417 (centre 288, i.e. 0.600 H), so everything moves by (+194, +193): logo at (357, 193),
title at (313, 352), the credits box at **(372, 393)**, the button grid at x 332/512, rows
507…610. In the Council Wars override (rows 159…443, centre 301) the shift is (+194, +201) and
the credits, which start at y 230 there, land at **(372, 431)**. All positions are absolute screen
coordinates (§10.1). The credits box is the one code-positioned element of this screen, so the
two `intro credits text` sites of §10.7 (`0x00404EA0` x, `0x00404E99` y; file `0x42A0`/`0x4299`)
no longer follow the (+192, +144) letterbox rule: `patch_resolution.py` carries them as per-build
fixups computed from the same numbers (Classic 200 + round(288·(H/480 − 1)) + 20, ENGEXP16 230 +
round(301·(H/480 − 1)) + 20, x = (W − 280)/2), and `paint_intro.py plan` prints where they must
be. Both exes were re-patched from their `.bak` on 10 Sep 2026: still 165 edits, exactly two
dwords different from the release build (x 370 → 372, y 344 → 393 / 374 → 431). `pad_background.py`
now recognises a script that already says `size W H` for the target framebuffer and leaves it
and its GIF alone, so re-running it on the repository is still a no-op, and its `revert` restores
the stock 640×480 set. Applied to `DC - Classic`, `DC - Council wars` and both test builds
(identical output, seed 7); `paint_intro.py preview` composites the settled logo frames, the
button cells and the credits rectangle over the new background for checking without launching
the game. **Not yet seen in the game.** The `unmask` blit path was inferred from the baked
backdrop, not read; if the game masks index 0 after all, the rebaked sprites still work (their
stars then coincide with the background's).

#### 10.12 The Windows pointer: an uninitialised class cursor and a `WM_SETCURSOR` that falls through **(verified in code; game test pending)**

Symptom on a modern Windows: the system pointer shows over the game — a plain arrow on the first
loading screen, and later, on the main menu and in battle, an icon-sized block that flickers
against the game's own cursor. The game cursor itself is fine: it is a `BltFast` from one of the
32 `cursor/cursor%d.bmp` surfaces (§7), positioned from `0x004DFF14/1C`. What flickers is the
*Windows* pointer, which the stock code hides with `SetCursor(NULL)` (`0x00408CD0` once after
the initial load, `0x0042F2B8` once per frame) but lets the system bring back through two holes:

* **`create_window` (`0x0042E688`) never writes `WNDCLASSA.hCursor`.** The structure is built in
  the stack frame at `[ebp-0x28]`; every field is stored except `[ebp-0x10]` (`hCursor`), so the
  class is registered with whatever the previous callee left in that slot. Windows restores the
  class cursor every time the mouse moves (the `SetCursor` contract: a self-drawn cursor needs a
  NULL class cursor). A stray handle that happens to be a valid icon draws as a cursor — icons
  and cursors are one object type — which is the "block".
* **The window procedure (`0x0042E340`) answers `WM_SETCURSOR` and then calls `DefWindowProcA`
  anyway.** `0x0042E36E: push 0 / call SetCursor / jmp 0x0042E3ED` — and `0x0042E3ED` is the
  common `DefWindowProcA` tail, whose `WM_SETCURSOR` handling sets the class cursor straight
  back. The handler has to return TRUE (halt processing) instead. For the record, the same
  procedure only knows three messages: `WM_DESTROY` (2) → `0x0042E2B0` + `PostQuitMessage`,
  `WM_SETCURSOR` (0x20), and `WM_SYSCOMMAND` (0x112) with `SC_SCREENSAVE` (0xF140) → the assert
  path (`sysfile`, line 0x149, exit).

The message pump at `0x0042F1C8` also peeks `WM_SETCURSOR` (`PeekMessageA(…, 0x20, 0x20,
PM_REMOVE)`) and calls `SetCursor(NULL)` when it finds one, but `WM_SETCURSOR` is a *sent*
message and never sits in the posted queue, so that branch is dead code.

**The fix (`tools/patch_cursor.py`, 4 code sites + 7 `.reloc` entries per binary):**

| Site | Classic VA (file) | Change |
|---|---|---|
| window proc `WM_SETCURSOR` | `0x0042E351` (`0x2D751`), 40 bytes | `SetCursor(NULL); mov eax,1; jmp` epilogue `0x0042E3FE` — no `DefWindowProcA` |
| `create_window` class | `0x0042E6AF` (`0x2DAAF`), 52 bytes | `mov [ebp-10h],ebx` (ebx = 0) before `RegisterClassA` → `hCursor = NULL` |
| `create_window` show | `0x0042E794` (`0x2DB94`), 7 bytes | `call cs:[UpdateWindow]` → `call stub` |
| stub | `0x0047F1D0` (`0x7E5D0`), 12 bytes | `push 0; call SetCursor; jmp UpdateWindow` — hides the pointer before the loading screen, tail-calls the original |

None of this moves other code. The room comes from rewriting Watcom's 7-byte
`2E FF 15 imm32` (`call cs:[import]`) as 5-byte relative calls to the import thunks the linker
already emitted at the end of `AUTO` (`jmp dword ptr [import]`: `SetCursor 0x0047EFF0`,
`UpdateWindow 0x0047EF8A`, `RegisterClassA 0x0047EF9C`, `GetStockObject 0x0047EFA2`,
`LoadIconA 0x0047EFA8`), which behave identically and carry no absolute pointer; `je rel32` →
`je rel8` and `push 1 / pop eax` for `mov eax,1` save the rest. The stub sits in the zero tail of
`AUTO` (raw data runs to `0x0047F1FF`, last real byte `0x0047F1C9`), inside the section's mapped
size. The `.reloc` block for page `0x2E000` is kept exact: the two absolute operands that move
(`hInstance` load, class-name immediate) get their new offsets, the five that vanished (four
IAT operands and the `UpdateWindow` one) become `IMAGE_REL_BASED_ABSOLUTE` padding.

Council Wars `DCEXP16.EXE`: identical bytes at +0x60 (`0x0042E3A0`, `0x0042E6E8`, `0x0042E7F4`,
thunks `0x0047F050/0x0047EFEA/0x0047EFFC/0x0047F002/0x0047F008`, stub `0x0047F230`; its `AUTO`
tail is 471 zero bytes), only the class-name pointer differs (`0x0048591C` vs `0x00485914`). All
relative displacements are therefore the same in both builds. Applied to both repository exes on
10 Sep 2026 on top of the 165 resolution edits; `patch_cursor.py verify` tells stock from patched
by the window-procedure bytes, so it does not depend on MD5s. Both patched binaries were
re-disassembled and the eight regions decode as intended. **Not yet seen in the game.** If the
arrow still shows on the loading screen after this, the remaining suspect is window ghosting
(the thread does not pump messages while loading; the ghost window Windows substitutes after
~5 s has an arrow class cursor) — the remedy would be `DisableProcessWindowsGhosting` via
`LoadLibraryA`/`GetProcAddress` at start-up, not another cursor call.

### Stage 4 — cursors and movies

* Cursors are `IDirectDrawSurface` blits at 1:1, so they simply look small. Redrawing
  `CURSOR/cursor%d.bmp` at 1.6× is optional and independent.
* The flickering *Windows* pointer over the game (uninitialised class cursor, `WM_SETCURSOR`
  falling into `DefWindowProcA`) is fixed by `tools/patch_cursor.py` — §10.12.
* Movies: **done in §10.8** — the source is 320×180, the stock path is a fixed 2× software
  doubler that skips every other row, and the fix re-routes the frames through the existing
  320×180 movie surface and a stretching `Blt` to `(0,96)-(1024,672)`; the back-buffer clear
  now reads width/pitch/height from its own Lock. Ten sites. README goal 3 ("increase quality of
  movies") becomes easier after this: a higher-resolution re-encode would only need the movie
  surface size (`0x0040722B/30`) and the 1:1 writer's row length to follow `biWidth`/`biHeight`,
  which `draw_offscreen` already reads from the `BITMAPINFO`.

### Stage 5 — HUD reflow (data only)

No patching and no reverse engineering here: the HUD is `MAINE` + `INTRFACE.GIF` +
`MAINBUT.SPR` (§6.1). `MAINBUT.SPR` needs no change at all — the buttons are the same buttons.

`tools/hud_layout.py` is the scaffolding: `spec` prints the region geometry below, `extract` cuts
the frame into per-region layers plus tracing masks, `template` renders a target-resolution guide
to paint into, and `maine plan|apply|revert` does the script transform (75 right-panel widgets
`x += 384`, 6 bottom-bar widgets `y += 288`, `size 1024 768`; the one mid-map widget,
`picture #199` at (200,160), is reported and left alone). Verified idempotent, and `revert`
restores `MAINE` byte-for-byte.

#### 5.1 What actually has to be drawn **(verified by measurement)**

The frame is 8.9 % opaque and splits into five regions. Four of the five extend with no new
artwork, which was not obvious before measuring:

| Region | Source | Target | Grows | Extends how |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `left_border` | (0,0) 4×480 | (0,0) 4×768 | +288 h | detail; only ~78 px periodic — pick a repeat segment or draw |
| `top_border` | (0,0) 640×6 | (0,0) 1024×6 | +384 w | detail; only ~77 px periodic — same |
| `map_edge` | (515,0) 3×480 | (899,0) 3×768 | +288 h | **constant** over y=94…399: tile one column, free |
| `right_panel` | (516,0) 124×480 | (900,0) 124×768 | +288 h | **287 rows carry only 6 px** of side rail (x=516,517 and 636…639): tile that row, free |
| `bottom_bar` | (0,454) 640×26 | (0,742) 1024×26 | +384 w | the message box interior (x 53…508) is 4 columns in random alternation: tile a stretch of it, free (§10.6 — the first reading, "needs real artwork", was wrong) |

So the drawing work is the bottom bar's extra 384 px, plus a chosen repeat or hand-work for the two
outer borders. The right panel's 288 px of new height and the map edge's come free — the panel
interior over that range is transparent, because the `MAINBUT.SPR` widgets are drawn over it.

1. **Vectorise before repainting.** Do not resample the 640×480 art up to 1024×768. Trace each
   element to vector (SVG) first, keep the vector as the master, and render the raster from it at
   the target size. Rendering from geometry is what keeps edges sharp — a 1.6× resample can only
   blur or blockify what is already there, whereas a traced bevel or border re-rendered at 1024×768
   is exactly as crisp as the original was at 640×480, and gradients and highlights come out
   smoother than the 8-bit source. It also turns this from a one-off repaint into an asset
   pipeline: commit the SVGs and any future resolution (1440p, 4K, or the 800×600 that §9 rejects
   for code reasons) is a re-render, not another manual repaint.

   **Which elements this pays off on.** `INTRFACE.GIF` is not uniform material — measured over its
   27 230 opaque pixels (80 distinct palette indices):

   | Measure | Value | Reading |
   |---|---|---|
   | mean horizontal run | 1.93 px (median 1, max 634) | mixed: long structural runs plus fine noise |
   | opaque px in runs ≥ 4 px | 43.4 % | the structural half — borders, bevels, panel outlines |
   | opaque px in runs of 1 px | 44.7 % | per-pixel shading detail |
   | pixels matching the one below | 32.5 % | little vertical coherence |
   | dither-pattern pixels | 6.1 % | deliberate 2-colour dithering |

   So split the work: **trace the structural 43 %** — the frame borders, the bevels, the rectangular
   panel outlines, and above all the map-view hole boundary, which is mostly long axis-aligned runs
   and vectorises essentially losslessly. Do **not** blindly trace the noisy interior fill; a
   general-purpose tracer turns 44.7 % single-pixel detail and 6.1 % dither into thousands of
   micro-paths that render worse than the original. Handle those regions as tiled/procedural
   texture, or with a pixel-art-aware upscaler, or by hand.

   **Tools.** Inkscape's *Trace Bitmap* with multi-colour scans, or its *Pixel art* mode
   (Kopf–Lischinski depixelization, `libdepixelize`) which is designed for exactly this kind of
   source; `potrace`/`autotrace` per colour plane for scripted runs. Snap traced geometry to the
   pixel grid so borders stay axis-aligned.

   **Two hard constraints on the render-back step.** (a) The output must be **8-bit indexed in the
   game's existing palette** (`MAINE` says `palette palette`, i.e. `PALETTE.GIF`/`.RGB`/`.RMP`) —
   `gifload.c` consumes indices directly and does no re-quantisation. (b) The erase colour must
   stay **exactly index 254** across the whole map-view hole: render the hole as a hard mask, with
   anti-aliasing and dithering **off** at its boundary. Any interpolated near-black pixel that is
   not index 254 stops being transparent and shows as a halo along the edge of the map view.

   **Sequencing.** Nothing is blocked. `INTRFACE.GIF` is a plain GIF, and `.SPR` is decoded with a
   working codec in `tools/spr.py` (§6.3), so traced cells can be re-imported into `MAINBUT.SPR` and
   the fonts as soon as the SVGs exist. Use `spr.py extract` → trace → render → `spr.py build`, and
   `spr.py check` to verify. Fonts are the strongest vectorisation candidate of all — glyphs are
   shapes, and a vector font makes every future resolution free.

2. **`INTRFACE/INTRFACE.GIF`** — render at 1024×768 from the vector master. The 8.9 % of it that is
   opaque has to move:
   the transparent hole becomes `(4,6)-(899,741)` (896×736), the left border stays at columns 0–3,
   the top border at rows 0–5, the map-view right edge moves from columns 515–517 to 899–901, the
   right screen border from 636–639 to 1020–1023, and the bottom bar from rows 454–479 to 742–767.
   The 124 px-wide panel column and the 26 px-tall bottom bar keep their pixel dimensions, so most
   of the existing artwork can be translated rather than redrawn — except that the panel column is
   now 768 px tall instead of 480 and needs 288 px of new filler between the widget groups.
3. **`INTRFACE/MAINE`** — shift the widget coordinates:
   * the 75 right-panel widgets (x `516…638`) → `x += 384`, giving x `900…1022`;
   * the 4 bottom-bar widgets (y `460…463`) → `y += 288`, giving y `748…751`;
   * the 3 message-line widgets over the map (`in_text #203`/`#204` at y 425/440, `picture #199`)
     → `y += 288` to stay the same distance above the bottom bar;
   * leave `size 640 480` → `size 1024 768`.
   That is a scripted edit over one text file, easy to verify by re-parsing and re-checking the
   zone counts.
4. The minimap is **not** in `MAINE` — it is the code patch in stage 3.
5. Optionally re-render the other 18 × 640×480 `INTRFACE/*.GIF` backgrounds at 1024×768 — same
   vector-first route as step 1, and easier there because they are full images with no transparency
   hole to preserve — then drop the `size 192 144 640 480` centring from stage 2.
6. Optionally redraw the fonts (`INTRFACE/FONT.SPR`, `MFONT*`) larger, from vector outlines per
   step 1 and via `tools/spr.py` (§6.3). `FONT.SPR` is 122 raw cells, 1…38 px wide by 28…29 tall —
   variable-width glyphs starting at `!`, with an alien head in place of `*`. The widget scripts
   carry per-font metrics, so a larger font is a data change plus a per-script `x y w h`
   adjustment.

Because stages 2 and 5 are pure data, they can be developed and tested against the **unpatched**
exe first (a 640×480 `MAINE` with shifted coordinates will simply look wrong, but it proves the
parse), which de-risks them completely.

### Stage 6 — parity and release

* ~~Apply every stage to `ENGEXP16.EXE` and diff-verify.~~ **Done in §10.10** (165 edits, three
  build fixups, `exp/` overrides handled by `pad_background.py`); game test by the maintainer
  pending.
* Council Wars `dc16.exe`: re-derive all offsets in Ghidra (only the §3 anchor transfers).
* The map editor (`maped_by_ozy_ns_v1.2PL.exe`) is a separate binary with its own 640×480
  assumptions and is **not** covered here.
* Commit each stage separately with a message describing the behaviour change, per the repo
  convention.

## 11. Risks

| Risk | Assessment |
|---|---|
| No fallback if 1024×768×16 is refused | Real. `set_mode_16` / `create_surfaces` abort. Mitigate by keeping the unpatched exe alongside, and consider adding a mode-list walk later. |
| `pitch != width * 2` on the offscreen surface | The code ignores `lPitch` everywhere. For a `SYSTEMMEMORY` surface DirectDraw has always returned a tight pitch; 1024 px = 2048 B is a friendlier alignment than 1280 B, so this is lower risk after the change than before. Verify once in stage 1. |
| A missed hardcoded 640 | The §8.2 sweep was systematic but §8.3 lists three unresolved items. Symptom would be a skewed or torn band rather than a crash. |
| A missed hardcoded **512 / 448** (viewport constants) | **Realised once (§10.6):** `draw_terrain` steps the lightplane by a literal 512 per row; symptom was a regular grid of black lines, not a crash. Fixed (31 sites). Any other buffer sized from the viewport and filled by a hand-unrolled loop is a candidate for the same. |
| Menu scripts drifting from the exe | Low: the `size` line is data and the parser accepts both forms (§6, verified). |
| Multiplayer fairness | Stage 3 changes what a player can see. Not a desync (§10 stage 3), but a balance issue between patched and unpatched clients. Decide whether to gate it. |
| Growing `.bss` | Not needed — nothing resolution-dependent lives there (§5). |
| A fixed-size render buffer | **Realised, identified (§10.4) and fixed (§10.5).** `draw_terrain`'s stack lightmap holds 5248 bytes; the frame is now grown to fit (11 code sites + 2 PE header fields), and 28×23 tiles run. The 144-byte row stride is fine up to 34 across because the overflow only hits unused cells. Remaining unknown: lighting at the right edge was reasoned, not seen. |
| Stack usage | The grown `draw_terrain` frame is 7 KB (28×23). Watcom has no stack probe, so the patch also raises the PE stack commit to 256 KB and the reserve to 1 MB. Any other function found to size a buffer from the view will need the same treatment. |

## 13. How this was produced

`dumpbin -NOLOGO -ALL -DISASM` output of Classic `dc16.exe` (`dc16.asm` in the development
folder), plus:

* the `DGROUP` raw hex dump reassembled into a binary to extract strings with their VAs
  (`VA = file offset + 0x402800`), which gave the assert `*.c` file names and hence a **module map
  in link order** — that is what localised the renderer to `engmain.c` / `lighting.c` /
  `sprite.c` / `juicel.c`;
* following the DirectDraw COM vtable offsets (`IDirectDraw::CreateSurface` `+0x18`,
  `SetCooperativeLevel` `+0x50`, `SetDisplayMode` `+0x54`; `IDirectDrawSurface::Blt` `+0x14`,
  `Flip` `+0x2C`, `GetAttachedSurface` `+0x30`, `GetDC` `+0x44`, `GetSurfaceDesc` `+0x58`,
  `Lock` `+0x64`, `SetPalette` `+0x7C`, `Unlock` `+0x80`) and the `DDSURFACEDESC` layout;
* enumerating the call sites of the `ctx+0x8C` / `ctx+0x90` lock/unlock pair to get the complete
  set of direct framebuffer writers;
* a scripted sweep of `shl reg, 4…12` preceded by a `×3`/`×5` idiom to find the strength-reduced
  strides of §8.2, which a search for `280h` alone does not find;
* relocation-tolerant byte matching of a window around each Classic site against `ENGEXP16.EXE`
  and Council Wars `dc16.exe` (masking any dword in `0x401000…0x542000`) to produce the
  cross-binary offsets, then a byte-for-byte re-check of every match; for §10.10 the same idea
  run as a sweep (a 32-byte window every `0x40` bytes, searched ±`0x200`) to get the delta *map*
  of the whole code section rather than one offset per site, plus `dumpbin -HEADERS` of both
  builds to separate file-pointer shifts from virtual-address shifts, and a `dumpbin -ALL -DISASM`
  of `ENGEXP16.EXE` (`engexp16.asm` in the development folder) to compare the `TTY`/`PIC` call
  sites and read the `exp/` opener;
* reading `INTRFACE/MULTIE~1.TXT`, `LOPTE` and `MAINE` directly, which is how the interface
  scripts turned out to be editable text;
* to identify the HUD: resolving every `intrface/*`, `sprites/*`, `animate/*`, `gamestat/*` string
  in `DGROUP` to the code addresses that reference it, then mapping those addresses to modules via
  the assert-string module map — which showed `"intrface/main"` being loaded by `proto.c` right
  beside the map-view rect, rather than by `interface.c` as the module name suggests;
* decoding `INTRFACE.GIF` with PIL and histogramming the presumed map rect against the rest, then
  reducing per-column and per-row opacity to runs, to confirm the frame geometry independently of
  the disassembly.

* to localise the §10.3 crash: a **viewport sweep** rather than a code audit — `--viewport`
  separates the map-view size from the framebuffer size, so four builds bracket the failure
  between 20×16 and 24×19 tiles and prove the arithmetic innocent; then `cdb` (WinDbg store
  package, `x86\cdb.exe`) driven by a `-cf` command file, whose register dump identified the one
  corrupted local from `esi = (index << 2) + [ebp+0x56]` in a single capture. Both are worth
  reaching for before sweeping the disassembly: the §10.2 lesson repeats itself here;

* to find the §10.4 buffer: a `cdb` **hardware watchpoint** on the one corrupted local, with the
  legitimate writer filtered out inside the breakpoint command — it named the store in a single
  run, after three earlier runs had been silently armed at the wrong address because `bp dc16+...`
  parses `dc16` as a hex *number*. Then the two caps were derived from the store's own index
  arithmetic and checked against the four bisection builds, which is what turned one register dump
  into a closed-form limit on both viewport dimensions;

* to decode `.SPR` (§6.3): reading `juicel.c`'s parser and both blitters rather than pattern-matching
  the files, then validating by re-encoding all 15 088 compressed cells and by rendering cells to PNG
  (the buttons and font glyphs are immediately recognisable, which is the cheapest possible check
  that a palette-and-RLE guess is right).

Three dead ends worth recording, so they are not repeated: the in-game panel is **not** in a `.SPR`
bank of its own (it is the `INTRFACE.GIF` background of `MAINE`); `interface.c` is the
save/load/options **dialog** module (`intrface/lsg`, `lobj`, `lqc`, `lopt`), not the HUD; and the
`.SPR` palette starts at offset **8**, not at the first `3F 3F 3F` triple — assuming the latter puts
the cell directory at 779 instead of 776, which by coincidence makes width/height look big-endian
and fits some files but not others.
